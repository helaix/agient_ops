# Desktop Command Center View

This component implements the Desktop Command Center View for the Multi-Agent Management system, providing a comprehensive "God Mode" interface inspired by RTS games.

## Overview

The Desktop Command Center View serves as the primary interface for desktop users, offering a complete overview of all agents in the system and powerful controls for managing them. It features:

- **Top Bar**: Global commands, search, and system status indicators
- **Left Sidebar**: Agent roster with status indicators and quick-access controls
- **Main Viewport**: Three different visualization modes:
  - **Map View**: Spatial representation of agents and their relationships
  - **Timeline View**: Gantt-style visualization of agent tasks and dependencies
  - **Kanban View**: Drag-and-drop task management across agent workstreams
- **Right Sidebar**: Context panel showing details for selected agent/task
- **Bottom Bar**: Resource metrics, notifications, and system messages

## Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML structure for the Command Center View
- `styles.css`: CSS styling for all components
- `script.js`: JavaScript functionality for interactivity and data visualization

## Integration Points

This component is designed to be integrated with other views in the Multi-Agent Management system:

1. **Desktop Agent Detail View**: When a user selects an agent in the Command Center, it should be possible to navigate to the Agent Detail View for more in-depth information.

2. **Desktop Workflow Designer**: The Command Center should provide access to the Workflow Designer for creating and editing agent workflows.

3. **Unified Showcase Page**: This component is built to be loaded into the Unified Showcase Page along with other screen implementations.

## Integration Requirements

To integrate this component with the Unified Showcase Page:

1. Include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the appropriate locations
2. Ensure the D3.js library is loaded (used for the Map View visualization)
3. Implement navigation between this view and other views (Agent Detail, Workflow Designer)
4. Connect to the shared data model for consistent agent information across views

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The Command Center supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

- **Alt + [Number]**: Select a specific agent (1-5 for the first five agents)
- **Ctrl + 1**: Switch to Map View
- **Ctrl + 2**: Switch to Timeline View
- **Ctrl + 3**: Switch to Kanban View
- **/** (Forward Slash): Open command input
- **Escape**: Close command input or notification panel

## Responsive Behavior

The Command Center is designed to be responsive within desktop screen sizes:

- Adapts to different desktop window sizes
- Maintains usability at various resolutions
- Provides appropriate UI density for desktop interaction

## Dependencies

- **D3.js**: Used for the interactive Map View visualization
- **Font Awesome**: Used for icons throughout the interface

## Sample Data

The current implementation uses sample data for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, this would be replaced with:

- API calls to fetch real agent data
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Integration with the backend agent management system

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for this component:

1. Real-time agent status updates via WebSockets
2. More advanced filtering and sorting options for agents
3. Enhanced visualization capabilities in the Map View
4. Expanded keyboard shortcuts for power users
5. Customizable dashboard layouts
6. Integration with analytics and reporting features
