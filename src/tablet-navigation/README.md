# Tablet Navigation Patterns Implementation

This component implements specialized navigation patterns for the tablet experience of the Multi-Agent Management system. These patterns are optimized for touch interfaces and medium-sized screens.

## Features

### Bottom Tab Bar
- Quick access to main views (Agents, Tasks, Workflows, Spatial)
- Visual indicators for active tab
- Badge notifications for unread/pending items
- Customizable tab order through the API

### Long-Press Actions
- Context menus for common operations
- Preview functionality for items
- Haptic feedback simulation
- Customizable long-press actions

### Two-Finger Gestures
- Zoom and pan in spatial views
- Rotation for 3D visualizations
- Pinch-to-filter in list views
- Multi-selection capabilities

### Swipe Navigation
- Move between related items or views
- Swipe actions on list items
- History navigation (swipe back/forward)
- Swipe to reveal additional options

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `css/styles.css` - Styling for all components
- `js/navigation.js` - Bottom tab bar and navigation functionality
- `js/gestures.js` - Two-finger gesture handling
- `js/longpress.js` - Long-press actions and context menus
- `js/swipe.js` - Swipe navigation and actions
- `js/data.js` - Sample data for demonstration
- `js/integration.js` - Integration with unified showcase
- `js/main.js` - Initialization and coordination

### Responsive Design
- Supports both portrait and landscape orientations
- Adapts to different tablet screen sizes
- Optimized for touch interactions

## Integration with Unified Showcase

This component is designed to be integrated into the unified showcase page along with other screen implementations. It provides several integration points:

### Integration Points
- **Top**: Connects to the tablet header component
- **Right**: Connects to the tablet context panel
- **Bottom**: Connects to the tablet command input
- **Left**: Connects to the tablet sidebar

### API for Integration
The component exposes a public API through the global `window.tabletNavigation` object:

```javascript
// Switch to a specific view
window.tabletNavigation.switchView('tasks-view');

// Update badge count for a tab
window.tabletNavigation.updateBadge('agents-view', 5);

// Reorder tabs
window.tabletNavigation.reorderTabs(['tasks-view', 'agents-view', 'workflows-view', 'spatial-view']);
```

### Event Communication
The component broadcasts events when tabs are changed:

```javascript
// Listen for tab changes
document.addEventListener('tabChanged', (e) => {
    const { viewId, source } = e.detail;
    console.log(`Tab changed to ${viewId} from ${source}`);
});
```

### Message Communication (for iframe integration)
When loaded in an iframe, the component communicates with the parent window using the `postMessage` API:

```javascript
// Example message sent to parent window
{
    type: 'TAB_CHANGED',
    componentId: 'tablet-navigation',
    viewId: 'agents-view'
}
```

## Development Tools

For development and testing, the component includes several tools:

- **Toggle Boundaries**: Shows component boundaries and integration points
- **Toggle Orientation**: Switches between portrait and landscape orientations
- **Device Selector**: Simulates different tablet screen sizes

These tools are automatically hidden when the component is loaded in the unified showcase.

## Browser Compatibility

- **Recommended**: Safari on iPad or Chrome on Android tablets
- **Also Supported**: Desktop browsers with touch simulation
- **Required Features**: Touch events, CSS Grid, Flexbox, CSS Variables

## Known Limitations

- Haptic feedback is simulated visually and with vibration API where available
- Some advanced gestures may not work in all browsers
- Performance may vary on older devices

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real data sources
- Improved accessibility features
- Additional customization options
- Performance optimizations for complex views
