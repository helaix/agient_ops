# Desktop Workflow Designer

## Overview

The Desktop Workflow Designer is a powerful visual interface for creating and managing multi-agent workflows within the Multi-Agent Management system. This component allows users to visually design how agents interact and collaborate to accomplish complex tasks.

## Features

### Canvas
- Drag-and-drop interface for creating agent workflows
- Grid or free-form layout options
- Zoom and pan controls
- Selection and multi-selection capabilities

### Agent Palette
- Available agents that can be added to workflows
- Agent categorization and filtering
- Search functionality
- Agent capability indicators

### Connection Tools
- Methods to define relationships and dependencies between agents
- Different connection types (data flow, control flow, context sharing)
- Connection styling options
- Validation indicators

### Validation Tools
- Real-time feedback on workflow viability
- Error and warning indicators
- Suggestion system
- Validation rule configuration

### Testing Interface
- Simulation capabilities for workflow testing
- Step-by-step execution
- Breakpoints and debugging tools
- Result visualization

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Delete/Backspace: Delete selected node or connection
- G: Toggle grid layout
- T: Toggle testing panel
- ?: Show/hide keyboard shortcuts
- Escape: Cancel connection, close panels, or deselect
- Alt+[1-9]: Quick add agent from palette
- Mouse Wheel: Zoom in/out
- Ctrl+Mouse Drag: Pan canvas

## Integration Points

The Desktop Workflow Designer integrates with other components in the system:

1. **Desktop Command Center View**: Users can navigate between the Command Center and Workflow Designer to monitor and create workflows.
2. **Desktop Agent Detail View**: Users can access detailed information about agents used in workflows.
3. **Unified Showcase**: The Workflow Designer is part of the unified showcase that demonstrates all UI components.

## Dependencies

- React
- React DnD (for drag and drop functionality)
- React Zoom Pan Pinch (for canvas zoom and pan)
- React Icons
- Styled Components

## Usage

```jsx
import WorkflowDesigner from './components/desktop/workflow-designer/WorkflowDesigner';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <WorkflowDesigner />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Data Models

The Workflow Designer uses the following data models:

- **Agent**: Represents an agent that can be added to the workflow
- **WorkflowNode**: Represents an agent instance in the workflow
- **Connection**: Represents a connection between two nodes
- **ConnectionType**: Enum for different types of connections (DataFlow, ControlFlow, ContextSharing)

## Future Enhancements

- Undo/redo functionality
- Save/load workflows
- Export workflows as JSON or other formats
- Integration with actual agent execution environment
- Advanced validation rules
- Custom node templates
- Collaborative editing
