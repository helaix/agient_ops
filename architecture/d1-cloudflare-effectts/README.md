## Architecture Principles

Based on the research findings, the architecture follows these key principles:

1. **Edge-First Design**: Leverage global edge distribution for optimal performance
2. **Functional Composition**: Use EffectTS patterns for robust error handling and type safety
3. **Serverless Scalability**: Design for automatic scaling with pay-per-use economics
4. **Data Locality**: Optimize data placement and access patterns for edge deployment
5. **Resilience by Design**: Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery strategies

## Integration with Research

This architecture documentation builds upon the comprehensive research completed in the `research/d1-cloudflare-effectts-prd/` directory:

- D1 Research Report: Database capabilities and limitations
- Cloudflare Workers Research: Runtime environment and performance characteristics
- EffectTS Research: Functional programming patterns and type safety
- Integration Analysis: Technical compatibility and architectural patterns
- Use Cases and Applications: Real-world implementation scenarios

## Next Steps

1. Review completed PRD document for technical accuracy and completeness
2. Create detailed system architecture based on research findings
3. Develop implementation guidelines and best practices
4. Document deployment and operational procedures
5. Create reference implementations and code examples
