3. **Integration Consistency Validation**
   - Verify integration patterns align with platform capabilities
   - Validate data flow and service interaction designs
   - Check for architectural anti-patterns or conflicts

4. **Use Case Alignment**

5. **Operational Excellence**: Enables reliable deployment and operations

## Integration with Graphite

This architecture work will be stacked on top of the PRD branch using Graphite:

1. **Base Branch**: `feature/hlx-1746-revisions-2025-05-22-research-prd`
2. **Architecture Branch**: `feature/hlx-1746-architecture-review`
3. **Graphite Stack**: Architecture PR will depend on PRD PR
4. **Review Process**: Sequential review of PRD then architecture
5. **Merge Strategy**: PRD merges first, then architecture

## Timeline and Coordination
