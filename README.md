# Agient Ops

A repository of operational patterns, workflows, and best practices for agent-based systems.

## Repository Structure

- **workflows/** - Collection of workflow patterns and documentation
  - **postmortems/** - Detailed postmortems from completed projects
  - **patterns/** - Base-level workflow patterns
  - **meta-patterns/** - Higher-order workflow patterns that coordinate multiple base patterns
  - **meta-meta-patterns/** - High-level coordination frameworks that adapt and evolve
  - **integrations/** - Integration patterns between different tools and platforms

## Remotion Media Parser Research Coordination

This repository includes documentation from the Remotion Media Parser research coordination project for Sparkflow, including:

1. **Postmortem**: Detailed analysis of the research coordination process, challenges, and solutions
2. **Workflow Patterns**: Documentation of reusable workflow patterns identified during the project
3. **Meta-Workflow Patterns**: Higher-order patterns for coordinating complex tasks
4. **Meta-Meta-Workflow Patterns**: Adaptive coordination frameworks for evolving projects

## GitHub-Linear Integration

This repository also includes documentation for GitHub-Linear integration strategies:

1. **Sync Strategy**: Comprehensive approach for synchronizing workplans between GitHub and Linear
2. **Workflow Patterns**: Reusable patterns for managing the GitHub-Linear relationship
3. **Automation Scripts**: Templates and examples for automating the synchronization process
4. **Postmortem**: Analysis of the implementation process and lessons learned

## Workflow Patterns

### Base Patterns
- **Research Coordination Workflow**: Coordinating distributed research tasks
- **Postmortem and Self-Analysis Workflow**: Reflecting on completed work and extracting learnings
- **Structured Feedback and Recognition Workflow**: Providing specific, constructive feedback
- **Hierarchical Communication and Reporting Workflow**: Managing communication across task hierarchy levels
- **GitHub-Linear Sync Workflow**: Synchronizing workplans and tasks between GitHub and Linear

### Meta-Patterns
- **Task Decomposition and Recomposition**: Breaking complex tasks into components and reassembling results
- **Dependency Management Workflow**: Managing relationships and dependencies between tasks

### Meta-Meta-Patterns
- **Adaptive Coordination System**: Self-adjusting coordination framework for complex projects
