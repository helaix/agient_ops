# Multi-Agent Management UI/UX Mockups

This repository contains UI/UX mockups for a multi-agent management system across desktop, tablet, and mobile form factors.

## Overview

The Multi-Agent Management system provides a comprehensive interface for monitoring, controlling, and orchestrating multiple AI agents. The UI/UX mockups demonstrate how this system would work across different device form factors.

## Components

### Desktop Experience
- **Command Center View**: Comprehensive "God Mode" view inspired by RTS games
- **Agent Detail View**: Detailed view when focusing on a specific agent
- **Workflow Designer**: Interface for creating multi-agent workflows

### Tablet Experience
- **Adaptive Command Center**: Touch-optimized interface with collapsible sidebars
- **Navigation Patterns**: Specialized navigation for touch interfaces

### Mobile Experience
- **Focused Interface**: Prioritizes essential information and actions
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Optimized navigation for small screens

### Cross-Device Features
- **Unified Command Language**: Consistent command syntax across all devices
- **Context Visualization**: Visual representation of context sharing between agents
- **Priority Management**: Visual system for managing priorities
- **Notification System**: Adaptive notifications across devices
- **Synchronization**: Seamless transition between devices

## Unified Showcase

The `unified-showcase.html` file provides a single page where all components can be viewed simultaneously. This allows for easy comparison and consistency checking across all designs.

## Development Approach

This project uses a multi-agent delegation approach where:

1. Each screen/view is delegated to a separate agent
2. All screen implementations are integrated into a single branch
3. The final deliverable includes a browser page where all screens can be viewed simultaneously

## Getting Started

To view the mockups:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `src/unified-showcase.html` in a web browser
3. Navigate through the different components to see how they work across different form factors
