## Documentation Standards

### Format and Structure

- Use Markdown for all documentation files

- Include a table of contents for documents longer than 500 words
- Use descriptive filenames in kebab-case (e.g., `getting-started-guide.md`)
- Organize content from general to specific, and from basic to advanced

### Style Guidelines

- Write in clear, concise language
- Use active voice and present tense
- Define acronyms and technical terms on first use
- Include examples and use cases where appropriate
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps and bullet points for non-sequential items
- Keep paragraphs and sentences short and focused

### Metadata and Cross-Referencing

- Include metadata at the top of each document (title, description, related areas, etc.)
