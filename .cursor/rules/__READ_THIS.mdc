# Agent Operations Guidelines and Workflow Selection Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Agent Operations repository! This repository contains essential documentation, guidelines, and reference materials for agent operations within the Codegen ecosystem. This guide will help you identify and implement the most appropriate workflow patterns for your current task. By following the decision pathways and utilizing the provided checklists, you can ensure consistent, effective execution of complex tasks.

## Key Resources

### Linear Workflows

When working with Linear issues, always refer to the [Linear Workflows Reference Guide](../../docs/reference/linear_workflows_reference.md) for comprehensive guidance on:

- Understanding Linear workflows and components
- Guidelines for working with Linear issues
- Task delegation and communication best practices
- Common tools and patterns
- Troubleshooting and examples

The [Linear Workflow Decision Diagram](../../docs/reference/linear_workflow_diagram.md) provides a visual guide for when to utilize the Linear Workflows Reference.

### Templates

When creating Linear issues, PRs, or status updates, use the standardized templates in the [Templates Documentation](../../docs/templates/README.md) which provides:

- Linear issue templates for different task types (feature development, bug fixes, research tasks)
- PR description templates following best practices
- Status update templates for progress reports and completion notifications
- Usage guidelines and examples for each template type

### Agent Collaboration

For multi-agent collaboration tasks, refer to the following resources:

- [Agent Collaboration Workflow](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_workflow.md): Core workflow definition
- [Implementation Guide](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_implementation_guide.md): Practical examples and code snippets
- [Quick Reference](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_quick_reference.md): Templates and checklists

### Communication and Delegation

For standardized communication and delegation practices, consult the [Communication and Delegation SOPs](../../docs/reference/communication_delegation_sops.md) which provides:

- Analysis of communication patterns
- Root causes of delegation failures
- Recommended solutions and SOPs
- Specific guidelines for delegating to sub-agents

### Self-Improvement Mechanisms

For continuous improvement of agent performance through systematic tracking, analysis, and feedback, refer to the [Self-Improvement Mechanisms](../../docs/reference/self_improvement/) which provides:

- [Error Tracking System](../../docs/reference/self_improvement/error_tracking/): Framework for identifying, categorizing, analyzing, and resolving errors
- [Success Pattern Analysis Framework](../../docs/reference/self_improvement/success_patterns/): Methodology for identifying and replicating successful patterns
- [Feedback Collection System](../../docs/reference/self_improvement/feedback_collection/): Structured approach to collecting and implementing feedback
- [Integration Framework](../../docs/reference/self_improvement/integration/): Comprehensive guide for integrating all components

The self-improvement mechanisms are designed to work alongside existing workflows to enhance agent performance and enable continuous learning.

## When to Use These Resources

1. **Starting a New Linear Task**: Review the Linear Workflows Reference
2. **Creating Linear Issues, PRs, or Status Updates**: Use the Templates Documentation
3. **Delegating Complex Tasks**: Consult both Linear Workflows and Agent Collaboration documents
4. **Communication Issues**: Refer to Communication and Delegation SOPs
5. **Code Management**: Follow guidelines in Agent Collaboration Workflow
6. **Specialized Workflow Patterns**: Use the Workflow Decision Pathways below to select the appropriate pattern
7. **Error Encountered**: Use the [Error Tracking System](../../docs/reference/self_improvement/error_tracking/) to document and resolve issues
8. **Successful Completion**: Apply the [Success Pattern Analysis Framework](../../docs/reference/self_improvement/success_patterns/) to capture learnings
9. **Receiving Feedback**: Utilize the [Feedback Collection System](../../docs/reference/self_improvement/feedback_collection/) to implement improvements
10. **Continuous Improvement**: Follow the [Integration Framework](../../docs/reference/self_improvement/integration/) for systematic enhancement

## Continuous Improvement

These documents are continuously updated based on feedback and evolving best practices. If you identify areas for improvement, please create an issue or PR with your suggestions.
