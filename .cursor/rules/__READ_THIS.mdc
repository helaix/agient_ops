# Agent Operations Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to the Agent Operations repository! This repository contains essential documentation, guidelines, and reference materials for agent operations within the Codegen ecosystem.

## Key Resources

### Linear Workflows

When working with Linear issues, always refer to the [Linear Workflows Reference Guide](../../docs/reference/linear_workflows_reference.md) for comprehensive guidance on:


- Understanding Linear workflows and components

- Guidelines for working with Linear issues

- Task delegation and communication best practices

- Common tools and patterns

- Troubleshooting and examples

The [Linear Workflow Decision Diagram](../../docs/reference/linear_workflow_diagram.md) provides a visual guide for when to utilize the Linear Workflows Reference.

### Agent Collaboration

For multi-agent collaboration tasks, refer to the following resources:


- [Agent Collaboration Workflow](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_workflow.md): Core workflow definition

- [Implementation Guide](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_implementation_guide.md): Practical examples and code snippets

- [Quick Reference](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_quick_reference.md): Templates and checklists

### Communication and Delegation

For standardized communication and delegation practices, consult the [Communication and Delegation SOPs](../../docs/reference/communication_delegation_sops.md) which provides:


- Analysis of communication patterns

- Root causes of delegation failures

- Recommended solutions and SOPs

- Specific guidelines for delegating to sub-agents

## Enhanced Documentation

### Example-Based Guides

For practical, step-by-step guidance with real-world examples, refer to our example-based guides:

- [Linear Workflow Guide: Complex Tasks](../../docs/examples/linear_workflow_guide_complex_tasks.md): Guide for complex, multi-step tasks

- [Linear Workflow Guide: Delegation](../../docs/examples/linear_workflow_guide_delegation.md): Guide for tasks requiring delegation

### Troubleshooting Guides

When encountering issues with Linear workflows, consult our comprehensive troubleshooting guides:


- [Common Linear Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/common_linear_issues.md): Comprehensive list of common issues and solutions

- [Linear API Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/linear_api_issues.md): Troubleshooting guide for API-related issues

- [Linear Delegation Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/linear_delegation_issues.md): Troubleshooting guide for delegation-related issues

- [Linear Branch Management Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/linear_branch_management_issues.md): Troubleshooting guide for branch management issues

- [Linear Communication Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/linear_communication_issues.md): Troubleshooting guide for communication-related issues

- [Linear Integration Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/linear_integration_issues.md): Troubleshooting guide for integration-related issues

### Decision Trees

For guidance on making optimal workflow decisions, refer to our decision trees:


- [Workflow Selection Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/workflow_selection_tree.md): Main decision tree for selecting appropriate workflows

- [Task Analysis Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/task_analysis_decision_tree.md): Decision tree for task analysis phase

- [Delegation Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/delegation_decision_tree.md): Decision tree for delegation decisions

- [Implementation Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/implementation_decision_tree.md): Decision tree for implementation approaches

- [Communication Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/communication_decision_tree.md): Decision tree for communication strategies

## When to Use These Resources

1. **Starting a New Linear issue**: Review the Linear Workflows Reference and use the Decision Diagram to navigate to the right section
2. **Implementing Specific Task Types**: Consult the relevant example-based guide for your task type
3. **Making Workflow Decisions**: Use the appropriate decision tree to guide your choices
4. **Troubleshooting Issues**: Check the relevant troubleshooting guide for your specific issue
5. **Delegating Complex Tasks**: Consult both Linear Workflows and Agent Collaboration documents
6. **Communication Issues**: Refer to Communication and Delegation SOPs
7. **Code Management**: Follow guidelines in Agent Collaboration Workflow
