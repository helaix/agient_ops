# Agent Operations Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to the Agent Operations repository! This repository contains essential documentation, guidelines, and reference materials for agent operations within the Codegen ecosystem.

## Key Resources

### Linear Workflows

When working with Linear issues, always refer to the [Linear Workflows Reference Guide](../../docs/reference/linear_workflows_reference.md) for comprehensive guidance on:

- Understanding Linear workflows and components
- Guidelines for working with Linear issues
- Task delegation and communication best practices
- Common tools and patterns
- Troubleshooting and examples

The [Linear Workflow Decision Diagram](../../docs/reference/linear_workflow_diagram.md) provides a visual guide for when to utilize the Linear Workflows Reference.

### Templates

When creating Linear issues, PRs, or status updates, use the standardized templates in the [Templates Documentation](../../docs/templates/README.md) which provides:

- Linear issue templates for different task types (feature development, bug fixes, research tasks)
- PR description templates following best practices
- Status update templates for progress reports and completion notifications
- Usage guidelines and examples for each template type

### Agent Collaboration

For multi-agent collaboration tasks, refer to the following resources:

- [Agent Collaboration Workflow](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_workflow.md): Core workflow definition
- [Implementation Guide](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_implementation_guide.md): Practical examples and code snippets
- [Quick Reference](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_quick_reference.md): Templates and checklists

### Communication and Delegation

For standardized communication and delegation practices, consult the [Communication and Delegation SOPs](../../docs/reference/communication_delegation_sops.md) which provides:

- Analysis of communication patterns
- Root causes of delegation failures
- Recommended solutions and SOPs
- Specific guidelines for delegating to sub-agents

## When to Use These Resources

1. **Starting a New Linear Task**: Review the Linear Workflows Reference
2. **Creating Linear Issues, PRs, or Status Updates**: Use the Templates Documentation
3. **Delegating Complex Tasks**: Consult both Linear Workflows and Agent Collaboration documents
4. **Communication Issues**: Refer to Communication and Delegation SOPs
5. **Code Management**: Follow guidelines in Agent Collaboration Workflow

## Continuous Improvement

These documents are continuously updated based on feedback and evolving best practices. If you identify areas for improvement, please create an issue or PR with your suggestions.
