# Agent Operations Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to the Agent Operations repository! This repository contains essential documentation, guidelines, and reference materials for agent operations within the Codegen ecosystem.

## Key Resources

### Linear Workflows

When working with Linear issues, always refer to the [Linear Workflows Reference Guide](../../docs/reference/linear_workflows_reference.md) for comprehensive guidance on:

- Understanding Linear workflows and components
- Guidelines for working with Linear issues
- Task delegation and communication best practices
- Common tools and patterns
- Troubleshooting and examples

The [Linear Workflow Decision Diagram](../../docs/reference/linear_workflow_diagram.md) provides a visual guide for when to utilize the Linear Workflows Reference.

**Enhanced Resources for Linear Workflows:**

- **For practical examples**: Use the [Linear Workflow Scenarios](../../docs/examples/linear_workflow_scenarios.md) for common scenarios and real-world examples
- **For step-by-step guidance**: Consult task-specific guides:
  - [Simple Tasks Guide](../../docs/examples/linear_workflow_guide_simple_tasks.md) for straightforward, single-agent tasks
  - [Complex Tasks Guide](../../docs/examples/linear_workflow_guide_complex_tasks.md) for multi-step, complex implementations
  - [Delegation Guide](../../docs/examples/linear_workflow_guide_delegation.md) for tasks requiring sub-agent coordination
- **For decision-making**: Use the [Workflow Selection Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/workflow_selection_tree.md) to determine the optimal approach
- **For troubleshooting**: Start with [Common Linear Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/common_linear_issues.md) for quick resolution

### Agent Collaboration

For multi-agent collaboration tasks, refer to the following resources:

- [Agent Collaboration Workflow](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_workflow.md): Core workflow definition
- [Implementation Guide](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_implementation_guide.md): Practical examples and code snippets
- [Quick Reference](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_quick_reference.md): Templates and checklists

**Enhanced Resources for Agent Collaboration:**

- **For delegation decisions**: Use the [Delegation Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/delegation_decision_tree.md) to determine when and how to delegate
- **For communication strategies**: Consult the [Communication Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/communication_decision_tree.md) for optimal communication approaches
- **For implementation planning**: Use the [Implementation Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/implementation_decision_tree.md) for complex task breakdown

### Communication and Delegation

For standardized communication and delegation practices, consult the [Communication and Delegation SOPs](../../docs/reference/communication_delegation_sops.md) which provides:

- Analysis of communication patterns
- Root causes of delegation failures
- Recommended solutions and SOPs
- Specific guidelines for delegating to sub-agents

**Enhanced Resources for Communication and Delegation:**

- **For delegation issues**: Use [Linear Delegation Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/linear_delegation_issues.md) for troubleshooting delegation problems
- **For communication problems**: Consult [Linear Communication Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/linear_communication_issues.md) for resolution strategies

### Troubleshooting and Problem Resolution

When encountering issues with Linear workflows, use our comprehensive troubleshooting resources:

- **Start here**: [Common Linear Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/common_linear_issues.md) - Comprehensive list of frequent issues and solutions
- **Specific issue types**:
  - [Linear API Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/linear_api_issues.md) - API-related problems
  - [Linear Branch Management Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/linear_branch_management_issues.md) - Git and branch management
  - [Linear Integration Issues](../../docs/troubleshooting/linear_integration_issues.md) - Integration and deployment issues
- **Research summary**: [Research Summary](../../docs/troubleshooting/research_summary.md) - Analysis of common issue patterns

### Decision Support

For guidance on making optimal workflow decisions, use our decision trees:

- **Primary decision point**: [Workflow Selection Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/workflow_selection_tree.md) - Main decision tree for selecting appropriate workflows
- **Specific decision areas**:
  - [Task Analysis Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/task_analysis_decision_tree.md) - For task analysis and planning
  - [Delegation Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/delegation_decision_tree.md) - For delegation decisions
  - [Implementation Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/implementation_decision_tree.md) - For implementation approaches
  - [Communication Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/communication_decision_tree.md) - For communication strategies

## When to Use These Resources

### Starting a New Linear Task
1. Begin with the [Linear Workflows Reference Guide](../../docs/reference/linear_workflows_reference.md)
2. Use the [Linear Workflow Decision Diagram](../../docs/reference/linear_workflow_diagram.md) to navigate to the right section
3. Consult the [Workflow Selection Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/workflow_selection_tree.md) for decision guidance

### Implementing Specific Task Types
- **Simple tasks**: [Linear Workflow Guide: Simple Tasks](../../docs/examples/linear_workflow_guide_simple_tasks.md)
- **Complex tasks**: [Linear Workflow Guide: Complex Tasks](../../docs/examples/linear_workflow_guide_complex_tasks.md)
- **Delegation required**: [Linear Workflow Guide: Delegation](../../docs/examples/linear_workflow_guide_delegation.md)
- **Common scenarios**: [Linear Workflow Scenarios](../../docs/examples/linear_workflow_scenarios.md)

### Making Workflow Decisions
- Start with the [Workflow Selection Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/workflow_selection_tree.md)
- Use specific decision trees for detailed guidance:
  - [Task Analysis Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/task_analysis_decision_tree.md)
  - [Delegation Decision Tree](../../docs/decision_trees/delegation_decision_tree.md)
