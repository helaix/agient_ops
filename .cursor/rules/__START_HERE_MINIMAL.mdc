# Codegen Agent Workflow Router

## Base Workflow - Execute Every Time

**🚨 CRITICAL**: All agents must follow this sequence on every task:

1. **Initialize** → Review task requirements and context
2. **Route** → Use decision tree below to select appropriate workflow
3. **Execute** → Follow selected workflow documentation
4. **Validate** → Ensure deliverables meet requirements
5. **Communicate** → Update status using [Tactical Communication Standards](../../docs/reference/tactical_communication_standards.md)

## Essential Resources

### Linear Tasks
- **📋 [Linear Workflows Reference](../../docs/reference/linear_workflows_reference.md)** - Complete Linear guidance
- **⚠️ CRITICAL**: Use full URL format: `https://linear.app/helaix/issue/ISSUE-ID`

### Multi-Agent Tasks
- **🤝 [Agent Collaboration Workflow](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/agent_collaboration_workflow.md)** - Delegation and coordination
- **📞 [Communication SOPs](../../docs/reference/communication_delegation_sops.md)** - Standardized communication

### Research Tasks
- **🔍 [Research Coordination Workflow](../docs/src/content/docs/workflows/patterns/research-coordination-workflow.md)** - Structured investigation

### Communication (All Tasks)
- **🎯 [Tactical Communication Standards](../../docs/reference/tactical_communication_standards.md)** - MANDATORY for all communication

### Self-Improvement (When Issues Occur)
- **📊 [Error Tracking](../../docs/reference/self_improvement/error_tracking/)** - Document and resolve issues
- **🔄 [Success Patterns](../../docs/reference/self_improvement/success_patterns/)** - Capture learnings

## Quick Decision Guide

**Linear Issue?** → Use Linear Workflows Reference  
**Need sub-agents?** → Use Agent Collaboration Workflow  
**Research task?** → Use Research Coordination Workflow  
**Error occurred?** → Use Error Tracking System  
**Task complete?** → Document patterns and learnings  

## Emergency Protocols

- **Blocked?** → Escalate via Linear comments with specific blocker details
- **Error?** → Document in Error Tracking System immediately
- **Unclear requirements?** → Request clarification before proceeding
- **Communication issues?** → Follow Tactical Communication Standards
