## When to Use Each Workflow Pattern

### Research Coordination Workflow
**Use when:** You need to investigate multiple aspects of a technology, concept, or solution.
**Documentation:** [Research Coordination Workflow](../docs/src/content/docs/workflows/patterns/research-coordination-workflow.md)
**Key indicators:**
- Task involves gathering information from multiple sources
- Requires synthesis of findings into cohesive recommendations
- Benefits from structured documentation of discoveries
- Involves evaluation against specific criteria

### Task Decomposition and Recomposition Meta-Workflow
**Use when:** You're facing a complex task that can be broken down into smaller, manageable components.
**Documentation:** [Task Decomposition Meta-Workflow](../docs/src/content/docs/workflows/meta-patterns/task-decomposition-and-recomposition-meta-workflow.md)
**Key indicators:**
- Task is too large for a single agent to complete efficiently
- Components can be worked on in parallel
- Clear interfaces exist between components
- Final solution requires integration of multiple parts

### Adaptive Coordination System Meta-Meta-Workflow
**Use when:** You're managing a complex project with evolving requirements or uncertain paths.
**Documentation:** [Adaptive Coordination Meta-Meta-Workflow](../docs/src/content/docs/workflows/meta-meta-patterns/adaptive-coordination-system-meta-meta-workflow.md)
**Key indicators:**
- Project has high uncertainty or evolving requirements
- Multiple coordination strategies might be needed
- Long-running initiative that will evolve over time
- Requires adaptation based on emerging information

### Hierarchical Communication and Reporting Workflow
**Use when:** You're managing communication across multiple levels of a task hierarchy.
**Documentation:** [Hierarchical Communication Workflow](../docs/src/content/docs/workflows/patterns/hierarchical-communication-and-reporting-workflow.md)
**Key indicators:**
- Multiple nested levels of tasks exist
- Information needs to flow between parent and child tasks
- Different stakeholders need different levels of detail
- Coordination across specialized domains is required

### Structured Feedback and Recognition Workflow
**Use when:** You need to provide feedback on completed work or acknowledge contributions.
**Documentation:** [Structured Feedback Workflow](../docs/src/content/docs/workflows/patterns/structured-feedback-and-recognition-workflow.md)
**Key indicators:**
- Reviewing work completed by other agents
- Need to reinforce effective practices
- Opportunity to acknowledge quality work
- Building a culture of continuous improvement

### Postmortem and Self-Analysis Workflow
**Use when:** You've completed a significant task and need to document learnings.
**Documentation:** [Postmortem Workflow](../docs/src/content/docs/workflows/patterns/postmortem-and-self-analysis-workflow.md)
**Key indicators:**
- Complex project has been completed
- Novel approaches or challenges were encountered
- Learnings could benefit future similar tasks
- Patterns emerged that could be generalized

## Integration with Existing Frameworks

The workflows documented here complement and extend the existing frameworks in the Agent Operations repository:

1. **Linear Workflows Reference**: For Linear-specific tools and processes
2. **Agent Collaboration Workflow**: For hierarchical delegation and code management
3. **Communication and Delegation SOPs**: For standardized communication practices

When implementing these workflow patterns, refer to the appropriate existing frameworks for specific implementation details related to Linear, collaboration, and communication.

## Continuous Improvement

These workflow patterns are continuously refined based on real-world application and feedback. If you identify improvements or new patterns, please document them using the Postmortem and Self-Analysis Workflow and contribute them to the repository.
