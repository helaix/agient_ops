## Key Findings: Optimal Prompting Techniques for Claude Models

### 1. XML Tag Structuring
**Category**: Prompt Structure Optimization
**Complexity Level**: Basic to Intermediate
**Evidence Base**: Anthropic Official Documentation + 5 Independent Sources

#### Description
XML tags are Claude's preferred method for structuring complex prompts. Unlike other LLMs that may treat XML as mere formatting, Claude has been specifically trained to understand and leverage XML structure for improved parsing and response accuracy.

#### Implementation
**Basic Example:**
```xml
<task>
Analyze the following customer feedback and provide actionable insights.
</task>

<context>
Our SaaS product has received mixed reviews about the user interface.
</context>

<feedback>
"The dashboard is confusing and I can't find basic features easily."
"Love the functionality but the design feels outdated."
"Navigation is not intuitive for new users."
</feedback>

<output_format>
Provide insights in the following structure:
1. Key themes identified
2. Specific improvement recommendations
3. Priority ranking (High/Medium/Low)
</output_format>
```

**Advanced Example:**
```xml
<role>You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience in distributed systems.</role>

<task>
Design a scalable microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform.
</task>

<requirements>
<functional>
