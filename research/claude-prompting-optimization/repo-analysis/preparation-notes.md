# Repository Analysis Preparation Notes

## Analysis Status
- **Status**: Waiting for prerequisite research completion
- **Prerequisites**: HNTSMN-705 (Claude Opus 4) and HNTSMN-706 (Claude Sonnet 4)
- **Branch**: feature/hntsmn-707-analyze-agent-ops-repository-for-prompting-technique
- **Prepared by**: Agent #22474
- **Date**: 2025-05-23

## Scaffolding Review Completed

### Available Templates
- ✅ Repository analysis template reviewed
- ✅ Research findings template reviewed  
- ✅ Evaluation criteria understood
- ✅ Project structure familiarized

### Key Areas Identified for Analysis

#### 1. Agent Rules and Guidelines
- `.cursor/rules/__START_HERE.mdc` - Main agent operations guide
- `.cursor/rules/__read_THIS.mdc` - Additional agent guidelines
- Contains workflow patterns, communication guidelines, and operational procedures

#### 2. Documentation and Workflows
- `docs/reference/` - Reference documentation with communication patterns
- `docs/src/content/docs/workflows/` - Workflow patterns and meta-patterns
- Contains structured approaches to task management and agent coordination

#### 3. Project-Specific Implementations
- `projects/voice-driven-mobile-app-tool/research/` - Contains AI model usage patterns
- Various postmortem documents with workflow analysis

#### 4. Communication and Delegation Patterns
- `docs/reference/communication_delegation_sops.md` - SOPs for agent communication
- `docs/reference/linear_workflows_reference.md` - Linear-specific workflows
- Agent collaboration guides and implementation patterns

## Preliminary Pattern Observations

### Current Prompting-Related Content Found
1. **AI Model References**: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude mentioned in voice app research
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Basic mentions in technical feasibility assessments
3. **Instruction Patterns**: Structured templates for agent instructions
4. **Context Provision**: Guidelines for providing context in agent communications
5. **Role-Based Responsibilities**: Clear role definitions in agent collaboration

### Areas Requiring Deep Analysis (Post-Research)
1. **Instruction Quality**: How well do current agent instructions align with Claude best practices?
2. **Context Management**: Effectiveness of current context provision patterns
3. **Communication Patterns**: Adherence to optimal prompting structures
4. **Template Effectiveness**: Quality of existing instruction templates
5. **Workflow Optimization**: Opportunities to improve agent coordination through better prompting

## Analysis Plan (Pending Research Completion)

### Phase 1: Pattern Identification
- Systematic review of all agent instruction patterns
- Cataloging of current prompting approaches
- Documentation of communication structures

### Phase 2: Best Practice Comparison
- Map current patterns against research findings
- Identify adherence and divergence areas
- Assess effectiveness gaps

### Phase 3: Recommendation Development
- Prioritize improvement opportunities
- Develop implementation roadmap
- Create specific enhancement proposals

## Next Steps
1. **Wait for Research Completion**: HNTSMN-705 and HNTSMN-706
2. **Review Research Findings**: Establish evaluation baseline
3. **Execute Comprehensive Analysis**: Using research-informed criteria
4. **Document Findings**: Using provided templates
5. **Push Analysis Branch**: Share completed work

## Notes for Future Analysis
- Focus on practical implementation patterns rather than theoretical concepts
- Emphasize actionable recommendations with clear implementation paths
- Consider both immediate improvements and long-term optimization opportunities
- Maintain alignment with existing agent operations framework
