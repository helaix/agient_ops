# Claude Prompting Optimization Research Project

## Project Overview

This research project investigates optimal prompting techniques for Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4, followed by analysis of our agent_ops repository for adherence to these best practices.

## Research Structure

### Phase 1: Prompting Technique Research
- **opus-4/**: Research on Claude Opus 4 optimal prompting techniques
- **sonnet-4/**: Research on Claude Sonnet 4 optimal prompting techniques  
- **comparative-analysis/**: Cross-model comparison and technique evaluation

### Phase 2: Repository Analysis
- **repo-analysis/**: Analysis of agent_ops repo against discovered best practices

### Phase 3: Synthesis
- **synthesis/**: Final recommendations and implementation roadmap

## Research Coordination

This project follows the Research Coordination Workflow pattern from our agent operations guidelines. Each research area is handled by specialized child agents with clear deliverables and evaluation criteria.

## Key Deliverables

1. Comprehensive prompting technique documentation for both models
2. Comparative analysis highlighting strengths and optimal use cases
3. Repository adherence/divergence analysis with specific findings
4. Actionable recommendations for improving our prompting practices
5. Implementation roadmap for adopting optimal techniques

## Success Criteria

- Complete coverage of current prompting research for both models
- Evidence-based recommendations with clear rationale
- Specific, actionable findings for repository improvements
- Unified documentation suitable for team adoption
