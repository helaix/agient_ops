# Tool Use Optimization for Claude Sonnet 4

## Technique Overview
**Technique Name:** Advanced Tool Use with Extended Thinking
**Category:** Advanced
**Complexity Level:** Advanced

## Description
Claude Sonnet 4 introduces revolutionary tool use capabilities that can be combined with extended thinking mode. This allows the model to alternate between deep reasoning and tool execution, creating sophisticated workflows that leverage both internal reasoning and external data sources. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes tool integration, while new API capabilities enable parallel tool execution and enhanced memory management.

## Implementation

### Basic Example
```python
# Basic tool use with extended thinking
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key='your_api_key')

tools = [
    {
        "name": "web_search",
        "description": "Search the web for current information",
        "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Search query"}
            },
            "required": ["query"]
        }
    }
]

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-4-sonnet-20250522",
    max_tokens=4000,
    tools=tools,
    extended_thinking=True,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": "Research the latest developments in quantum computing and provide a comprehensive analysis of their implications for cryptography."
        }
    ]
)
```

## Implementation Guide

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Define Tool Schema**
   ```python
   tool_schema = {
       "name": "tool_name",
       "description": "Clear description of tool purpose",
       "input_schema": {
           "type": "object",
           "properties": {
               "param1": {"type": "string", "description": "Parameter description"},
               "param2": {"type": "integer", "description": "Another parameter"}
           },
           "required": ["param1"]
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Tool Functions**
   ```python
   def execute_tool(tool_name, parameters):
       if tool_name == "web_search":
           return web_search(parameters["query"])
       elif tool_name == "code_execution":
           return execute_code(parameters["code"])
       # Add more tool implementations
   ```

3. **Create MCP Server (Optional)**
   ```python
   # Example MCP server setup
   from mcp import Server, Tool
   
   server = Server("my-tools")
   
   @server.tool("web_search")
   def web_search_tool(query: str) -> str:
       # Implementation here
       return search_results
   
   server.run()
   ```

4. **Handle Tool Responses**
   ```python
   def process_tool_response(response):
       if response.stop_reason == "tool_use":
           for tool_call in response.content:
               if tool_call.type == "tool_use":
                   result = execute_tool(tool_call.name, tool_call.input)
                   # Continue conversation with tool result
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Issue:** Tool calls fail or timeout
  - **Solution:** Implement retry logic and fallback strategies

- **Issue:** Context window overflow with tool results
  - **Solution:** Summarize tool outputs, use prompt caching

        }
    }
}
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Workflow Orchestration
```python
# Complex workflow with multiple tools
workflow_prompt = """
Execute this data analysis workflow:

1. Use extended thinking to plan the analysis approach
2. Query the database for raw data
3. Clean and preprocess the data using code execution
4. Generate statistical summaries and visualizations
5. Save results to files
6. Create a comprehensive report

Use tools strategically and validate results at each step.
"""
```

### Error Recovery
```python
# Robust error handling pattern
def robust_tool_workflow(client, prompt, tools, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = client.messages.create(
                model="claude-4-sonnet-20250522",
                tools=tools,
                extended_thinking=True,
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
            )
            return response
        except ToolError as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            # Modify prompt to handle the error
            prompt += f"\n\nNote: Previous attempt failed with error: {e}. Please try an alternative approach."
```
