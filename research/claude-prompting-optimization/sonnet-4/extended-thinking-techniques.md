# Extended Thinking Techniques for Claude Sonnet 4

## Technique Overview
**Technique Name:** Extended Thinking Mode Optimization
**Category:** Model-Specific
**Complexity Level:** Intermediate to Advanced

## Description
Extended thinking mode is Claude Sonnet 4's signature capability that allows the model to engage in visible, step-by-step reasoning for complex problems. Unlike standard mode's immediate responses, extended thinking allocates additional computational resources to thoroughly analyze problems, explore multiple approaches, and provide transparent reasoning processes.

## Implementation

### Basic Example
```
Please use extended thinking to analyze this software architecture problem:

We need to design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform that handles 100k+ daily transactions. Consider scalability, fault tolerance, and data consistency requirements.

Take time to think through different approaches and trade-offs before providing your recommendation.
```

### Advanced Example
```
<thinking_budget>5000</thinking_budget>

You are a senior software architect tasked with migrating a monolithic application to microservices. The current system has:
- 500k lines of code
- 50+ database tables with complex relationships
- 20+ external API integrations
- Peak load of 10k concurrent users

Use extended thinking to:
1. Analyze the current architecture and identify bounded contexts
2. Design a migration strategy with minimal downtime
3. Address data consistency challenges
4. Plan for gradual rollout and rollback capabilities
5. Consider monitoring and observability requirements

Provide a comprehensive migration plan with timeline and risk mitigation strategies.
```

### Best Practices
- **Start with general instructions**: Let Claude's creativity guide the initial approach
- **Set appropriate thinking budgets**: Begin with 1024 tokens minimum, scale up for complex problems
- **Use batch processing for large budgets**: For thinking budgets >32K tokens to avoid timeouts
- **Prefer English for thinking**: Extended thinking performs best in English, though output can be any language
- **Monitor token usage**: Extended thinking significantly increases token consumption
- **Combine with tool use**: Allow alternating between reasoning and tool execution

## Performance Analysis

### Effectiveness Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 15-25% improvement on complex reasoning tasks compared to standard mode
- **Response Quality**: Significantly higher quality for multi-step problems
- **Consistency**: More reliable results for complex analytical tasks
- **Speed**: 3-10x slower than standard mode due to deep reasoning

### Use Cases
- **Optimal for:**
  - Complex software architecture decisions
  - Multi-step mathematical proofs
  - Strategic business analysis
  - Code debugging and optimization
  - Research synthesis and analysis
  - Legal document analysis
  - Medical case studies

- **Not recommended for:**
  - Simple factual questions
  - Quick code snippets
  - Basic translations
  - Routine content generation
  - Real-time applications

- **Alternative techniques:**
  - Standard mode for simple tasks
  - Chain-of-thought prompting for moderate complexity
  - Tool use without extended thinking for data retrieval

## Implementation Guide

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Enable Extended Thinking**
   ```python
   import anthropic
   
   client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key='your_api_key')
   response = client.messages.create(
       model="claude-4-sonnet-20250522",
       max_tokens=4000,
       messages=[
           {"role": "user", "content": "Your complex problem here"}
       ],
       extended_thinking=True,
       thinking_budget=2048  # Optional: set specific budget
   )
   ```

2. **Structure Complex Prompts**
   - Clearly state the problem complexity
   - Indicate that deep thinking is needed
   - Provide all necessary context upfront
   - Specify desired output format

3. **Monitor and Optimize**
   - Track token usage patterns
   - Measure quality improvements
   - Adjust thinking budgets based on results
   - Use batch processing for large-scale operations

### Common Issues and Solutions
