const serviceCall = <T>(
  serviceName: string,
  operation: string,
  payload: unknown
): Effect<T, ServiceError, ServiceRegistry | CircuitBreaker> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const registry = yield* ServiceRegistry;
    const circuitBreaker = yield* CircuitBreaker;
    
    const instance = yield* registry.getHealthyInstance(serviceName);
    const result = yield* circuitBreaker.execute(
      () => callService(instance, operation, payload)
    );
    
    return result as T;
  });
```

#### Data Access Pattern
```typescript
// Type-safe database operations with caching
const dataAccess = <T>(
  query: SQLQuery,
  params: QueryParams
): Effect<T, DatabaseError, D1Service | CacheService> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const cache = yield* CacheService;
    const db = yield* D1Service;
    
    // Try cache first
    const cached = yield* cache.get(query.cacheKey);
    if (cached) return cached as T;
    
    // Execute query
    const result = yield* db.execute(query, params);
    
    // Cache result
    yield* cache.set(query.cacheKey, result, query.ttl);
    
    return result as T;
  });
```

#### Event Processing Pattern
```typescript
// Event-driven architecture with Effect
const eventProcessor = (
  event: DomainEvent
): Effect<ProcessingResult, ProcessingError, EventStore | ServiceLayer> =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const eventStore = yield* EventStore;
    const services = yield* ServiceLayer;
    
    // Store event
    yield* eventStore.append(event);
    
    // Process event through handlers
    const handlers = getEventHandlers(event.type);
    const results = yield* Effect.all(
      handlers.map(handler => handler.process(event)),
      { concurrency: 5 }
    );
    
    return { event, results };
  });
