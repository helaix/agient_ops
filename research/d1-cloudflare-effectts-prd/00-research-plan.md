# D1, Cloudflare Workers, and EffectTS Integration Research Plan

## Research Coordination Workflow

This research follows the Agent Operations guidelines for comprehensive technology stack analysis and PRD creation.

## Objective

Conduct comprehensive research and create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) that leverages Cloudflare D1, Cloudflare Workers, and EffectTS as an integrated technology stack.

## Research Phases

### Phase 1: Technology Deep Dive (Parallel Research)
- **D1 Research**: Database features, SQL compatibility, limitations, performance, integration patterns
- **Cloudflare Workers Research**: Runtime environment, V8 isolates, platform constraints, performance, APIs
- **EffectTS Research**: Functional programming patterns, TypeScript integration, error handling, testing

### Phase 2: Integration Analysis
- Technical compatibility analysis between all three technologies
- Architectural patterns for combining D1, Workers, and EffectTS
- Performance considerations for the full stack
- Development workflow and tooling requirements

### Phase 3: Use Case Identification
- Ideal problem domains and applications for this technology stack
- Competitive analysis vs. alternative solutions
- Real-world implementation examples and case studies
- Scalability and performance benchmarks

### Phase 4: PRD Synthesis
- Product vision and technical objectives
- Comprehensive requirements (functional and non-functional)
- Architecture recommendations and design patterns
- Implementation roadmap with milestones and success metrics

## Quality Standards

- All findings must be backed by official documentation or credible sources
- Include practical code examples and demonstrations
- Cite sources and provide verification links
- Document limitations, constraints, and considerations
- Ensure technical accuracy and practical applicability

## Documentation Standards

Each research document should include:
- Executive summary
- Detailed technical analysis
- Code examples and demonstrations
- Performance considerations
- Integration patterns
- Limitations and constraints
- Source citations and verification links

## Success Criteria

- **Completeness**: All key aspects of each technology covered
- **Accuracy**: Information verified against authoritative sources
- **Practicality**: Recommendations are actionable and implementable
- **Integration**: Clear understanding of how technologies work together
- **Value**: PRD provides clear business and technical value proposition

## Repository Context

This work is part of the broader Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen implementation project. The research and PRD should consider how this technology stack could support the overall project objectives while following the established Agent Operations patterns and workflows.
