# D1, Cloudflare Workers, and EffectTS Research & PRD

## Research Objectives

This directory contains research and documentation for creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) that leverages:

1. **Cloudflare D1** - SQLite-based serverless database
2. **Cloudflare Workers** - Edge computing platform
3. **EffectTS** - Functional programming library for TypeScript

## Research Areas

### 1. Technology Deep Dive
- D1 capabilities, limitations, and best practices
- Cloudflare Workers runtime environment and constraints
- EffectTS patterns and integration approaches

### 2. Architecture Patterns
- How these technologies work together
- Common architectural patterns and anti-patterns
- Performance considerations and optimization strategies

### 3. Use Cases and Applications
- Ideal scenarios for this technology stack
- Real-world examples and case studies
- Competitive analysis and alternatives

### 4. Implementation Considerations
- Development workflow and tooling
- Testing strategies
- Deployment and monitoring approaches

## Deliverables

1. **Research Report** - Comprehensive analysis of each technology
2. **Architecture Guide** - Integration patterns and best practices
3. **PRD Template** - Structured document for product requirements
4. **Final PRD** - Complete product requirements document

## Research Process

Following the Research Coordination Workflow from the Agent Operations guidelines:
- Systematic investigation of each technology area
- Synthesis of findings into cohesive recommendations
- Structured documentation of discoveries
- Evaluation against specific criteria for PRD creation

## Next Steps

1. Assign research sub-tasks to specialized agents
2. Conduct deep research on each technology
3. Synthesize findings into architectural recommendations
4. Create comprehensive PRD leveraging all three technologies
