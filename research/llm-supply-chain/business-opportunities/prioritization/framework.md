# Business Opportunity Prioritization Framework

## Scoring Methodology

Each of the 90 opportunities is evaluated across 5 key dimensions using a 1-10 scale:

### 1. Market Size (Weight: 25%)
**Criteria**: Total Addressable Market (TAM) and growth potential
- **10**: TAM > $50B, CAGR > 50%
- **8-9**: TAM $10-50B, CAGR 30-50%
- **6-7**: TAM $1-10B, CAGR 20-30%
- **4-5**: TAM $100M-1B, CAGR 10-20%
- **1-3**: TAM < $100M, CAGR < 10%

### 2. Competitive Moat (Weight: 20%)
**Criteria**: Defensibility and barriers to entry
- **10**: Strong network effects, proprietary data, high switching costs
- **8-9**: Significant technical barriers, regulatory moats
- **6-7**: Moderate differentiation, some switching costs
- **4-5**: Limited differentiation, low barriers
- **1-3**: Commoditized market, easy to replicate

### 3. Time to Market (Weight: 20%)
**Criteria**: Speed of implementation and market entry
- **10**: MVP in 3-6 months, market entry in 6-12 months
- **8-9**: MVP in 6-12 months, market entry in 12-18 months
- **6-7**: MVP in 12-18 months, market entry in 18-24 months
- **4-5**: MVP in 18-24 months, market entry in 24-36 months
- **1-3**: MVP > 24 months, market entry > 36 months

### 4. Resource Requirements (Weight: 15%)
**Criteria**: Capital, talent, and technology needs (inverse scoring - lower requirements = higher score)
- **10**: < $1M capital, small team (2-5 people), existing technology
- **8-9**: $1-5M capital, medium team (5-15 people), some R&D needed
- **6-7**: $5-20M capital, large team (15-50 people), significant R&D
- **4-5**: $20-100M capital, very large team (50+ people), major R&D
- **1-3**: > $100M capital, massive team, breakthrough R&D required

### 5. Strategic Fit (Weight: 20%)
**Criteria**: Alignment with existing capabilities and market position
- **10**: Perfect alignment with existing strengths and market position
- **8-9**: Strong alignment, minor capability gaps
- **6-7**: Good alignment, some capability development needed
- **4-5**: Moderate alignment, significant new capabilities required
- **1-3**: Poor alignment, major pivot or new expertise needed

## Composite Score Calculation

**Total Score = (Market Size × 0.25) + (Competitive Moat × 0.20) + (Time to Market × 0.20) + (Resource Requirements × 0.15) + (Strategic Fit × 0.20)**

## Priority Tiers

### Tier 1: High Priority (Score 8.0-10.0)
- Immediate focus for detailed business plan development
- Resource allocation priority
- Fast-track implementation consideration

### Tier 2: Medium Priority (Score 6.0-7.9)
- Secondary focus for business plan development
- Monitor market conditions for timing
- Consider strategic partnerships

### Tier 3: Low Priority (Score 4.0-5.9)
- Long-term consideration
- Watch for market evolution
- Potential acquisition targets

### Tier 4: Deprioritized (Score < 4.0)
- Not recommended for current focus
- Revisit in future market conditions

## Additional Considerations

### Risk Factors
- Regulatory uncertainty
