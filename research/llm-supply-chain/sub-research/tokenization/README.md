- Comparison with traditional approaches

**Key Features**:
```python
# Semantic-aware tokenization
tokenizer = SemanticTokenizer(domain='medical', preserve_semantics=True)
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize("The patient has pneumonia and needs acetaminophen 500mg")

# Quality assessment
quality = tokenizer.evaluate_quality(tokens)
print(f"Semantic coherence: {quality['semantic_coherence']:.3f}")

# Bias detection
bias_detector = BiasDetector()
bias_scores = bias_detector.detect_bias(tokenizer, test_texts)
```

```python
# Real-time processing pipeline
pipeline = StreamingTokenizationPipeline(
    buffer_size=1000,
    quality_threshold=0.7,
    max_latency_ms=100.0
)

# Process text stream
async for tokens in pipeline.process_stream(text_stream):
    # Process tokens in real-time
    process_tokens(tokens)
```
