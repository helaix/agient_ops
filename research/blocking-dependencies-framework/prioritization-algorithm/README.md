# Dependency-Based Prioritization Algorithm

## Overview

This component develops algorithms that prioritize issues based on their position in the dependency graph. The goal is to create intelligent prioritization that considers dependency relationships, issue complexity, deadlines, and resource constraints to optimize overall workflow efficiency.

## Research Questions

1. **How do we identify critical path bottlenecks in dependency graphs?**
   - What graph algorithms best identify critical paths?
   - How do we handle multiple parallel critical paths?
   - What metrics indicate bottleneck severity?

2. **What factors should influence dependency-based prioritization?**
   - Dependency relationships (blocking/blocked by)
   - Issue complexity and effort estimates
   - Deadlines and time constraints
   - Resource availability and skills
   - Business value and impact

3. **How can we balance dependency relationships with other priority factors?**
   - Multi-criteria decision making approaches
   - Weighted scoring algorithms
   - Dynamic priority adjustment mechanisms
   - Conflict resolution strategies

## Key Components

### 1. Critical Path Analyzer
```python
class CriticalPathAnalyzer:
    def calculate_critical_path(self, graph: DependencyGraph) -> List[str]
    def identify_bottlenecks(self, graph: DependencyGraph) -> List[BottleneckNode]
    def calculate_path_impact(self, path: List[str]) -> ImpactMetrics
```

### 2. Priority Scoring Engine
```python
class PriorityScorer:
    def calculate_dependency_score(self, issue: LinearIssue, graph: DependencyGraph) -> float
    def calculate_business_value_score(self, issue: LinearIssue) -> float
    def calculate_urgency_score(self, issue: LinearIssue) -> float
    def calculate_composite_score(self, scores: Dict[str, float]) -> float
```

### 3. Dynamic Priority Manager
```python
class DynamicPriorityManager:
    def recalculate_priorities(self, graph: DependencyGraph) -> Dict[str, int]
    def propagate_priority_changes(self, changed_issues: List[str]) -> List[str]
    def resolve_priority_conflicts(self, conflicts: List[PriorityConflict]) -> List[Resolution]
```

### 4. Optimization Engine
```python
class PriorityOptimizer:
    def optimize_for_throughput(self, graph: DependencyGraph) -> PriorityAssignment
    def optimize_for_deadlines(self, graph: DependencyGraph, deadlines: Dict[str, datetime]) -> PriorityAssignment
    def optimize_for_resources(self, graph: DependencyGraph, resources: ResourcePool) -> PriorityAssignment
```

## Prioritization Algorithms

### 1. Critical Path Priority (CPP)
Prioritizes issues based on their position in the critical path:
- Issues on the critical path get highest priority
- Priority decreases with distance from critical path
- Considers path length and complexity

### 2. Dependency Impact Score (DIS)
Calculates priority based on how many other issues depend on completion:
- Higher score for issues that block many others
- Considers both direct and indirect dependencies
- Weights by complexity of blocked issues

### 3. Weighted Multi-Criteria (WMC)
Combines multiple factors with configurable weights:
- Dependency relationships (40%)
- Business value (25%)
- Urgency/deadlines (20%)
- Complexity/effort (15%)

### 4. Resource-Optimized Priority (ROP)
Considers resource availability and skills:
- Matches issue requirements with available resources
- Optimizes for resource utilization
- Prevents resource conflicts and bottlenecks

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Feature Development Pipeline
**Context**: Multiple features in development with shared dependencies

**Issues**:
- Database migration (blocks 5 features)
- Feature A implementation (high business value)
- Feature B implementation (urgent deadline)
- Feature C implementation (low complexity)
- Testing infrastructure (blocks all testing)

**Expected Prioritization**:
1. Database migration (critical bottleneck)
2. Testing infrastructure (enables parallel testing)
3. Feature B (urgent deadline)
4. Feature A (high business value)
5. Feature C (lowest impact)

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix vs Feature Development
**Context**: Critical bugs competing with planned features

**Issues**:
- Security vulnerability fix (high urgency, blocks deployment)
- Performance optimization (affects user experience)
- New feature implementation (planned for release)
- Technical debt cleanup (enables future development)

**Expected Prioritization**:
1. Security vulnerability (critical, blocks everything)
2. Performance optimization (affects current users)
3. New feature (planned deliverable)
4. Technical debt (future enabler)

### Scenario 3: Multi-Team Coordination
**Context**: Multiple teams with interdependent work

**Issues**:
- Backend API changes (blocks frontend team)
- Frontend UI updates (depends on API)
- Mobile app updates (depends on API)
- Documentation updates (depends on all changes)
- QA testing (depends on all implementations)

**Expected Prioritization**:
1. Backend API changes (unblocks multiple teams)
2. Frontend UI updates (parallel with mobile)
3. Mobile app updates (parallel with frontend)
4. QA testing (validates all changes)
5. Documentation (final deliverable)

## Success Metrics

1. **Throughput Optimization**: Increase in overall issue completion rate
2. **Deadline Adherence**: Percentage of issues completed on time
3. **Resource Utilization**: Efficiency of team resource allocation
4. **Bottleneck Reduction**: Decrease in dependency-related delays
5. **Priority Accuracy**: Alignment with manual expert prioritization
