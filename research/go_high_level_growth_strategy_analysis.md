### The Pivot That Changed Everything

- Initial solution: Simple two-way text marketing and reputation management
- **Problem discovered:** Customers used it briefly then dropped off due to poor implementation

**The Breakthrough Insight:**
> "The thing that any business owner understands is that tasks like accounting and marketing are better outsourced. So, if we could create something that answered that marketing piece in a new way..." - Shaun Clark

**The White-Label Solution:**
- Made agency and software inseparable
- Clients couldn't cut out agencies once they discovered the software
- Created mutual dependency that benefits all parties
- Revenue sharing structure: company ↔ agencies ↔ affiliates

**Why This Was Revolutionary:**
- Traditional SaaS: Software company sells directly to end users
- GHL Model: Software company empowers agencies to sell under their own brand
- Result: Agencies become indispensable, creating stronger client relationships
