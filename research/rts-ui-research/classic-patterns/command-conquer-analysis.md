## Interface Analysis

### Spatial Layout Principles
- **Main View**: Central battlefield occupies majority of screen (~75%), isometric perspective with clear unit visibility
- **Minimap Design**: Integrated into right sidebar, rectangular format with terrain representation and unit indicators
- **Screen Real Estate**: Revolutionary right-side vertical sidebar (~20% of screen width) - the "Command & Conquer sidebar"
- **Zoom and Pan**: Fixed zoom level with smooth scrolling, edge-scrolling and minimap navigation
- **Information Hierarchy**: 
  1. Main battlefield (primary focus)
  2. Sidebar (construction, units, map)
  3. Resource display (top of sidebar)
  4. Selected unit info (bottom of sidebar)

### Resource Management Dashboard
- **Resource Types**: 
  - Credits (primary currency from Tiberium/Ore harvesting)
  - Power (generated by power plants, consumed by structures)
- **Dashboard Location**: Top section of right sidebar, always visible
- **Visual Design**: 
  - Credits: Numerical display with dollar sign or credit symbol
  - Power: Bar indicator showing power usage vs. generation
  - Color coding: Green for sufficient, red for insufficient power
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate updates as resources change, smooth power bar transitions
- **Alerts and Warnings**: 
  - "Insufficient funds" voice alert for construction attempts
  - Power bar turns red when insufficient power
  - Construction halts when power inadequate

### Unit/Agent Control Mechanisms
- **Selection Methods**: 
  - Single click for individual units
