# Classic RTS UI Pattern Synthesis

## Overview

This document synthesizes the UI patterns identified across three foundational RTS games: StarCraft, Command & Conquer, and Age of Empires. These games established the core interface paradigms that define real-time strategy gaming and provide valuable insights for AI agent management systems.

## Common Successful Patterns

### 1. Spatial Layout Principles

#### Central Workspace Dominance
**Pattern**: All three games dedicate 70-75% of screen real estate to the primary battlefield/workspace
- **StarCraft**: Central viewport with UI elements around edges
- **Command & Conquer**: Battlefield with vertical sidebar
- **Age of Empires**: Central view with bottom panel integration

**AI Agent Application**: Primary agent workspace should dominate the interface, providing clear visibility into agent activities and system state.

#### Persistent Overview Display
**Pattern**: Always-visible minimap/overview in consistent location
- **StarCraft**: Bottom-left square minimap
- **Command & Conquer**: Integrated into right sidebar
- **Age of Empires**: Bottom-left square minimap

**AI Agent Application**: System-wide agent overview panel should be persistently visible, showing agent distribution, status, and activity across the entire system.

#### Fixed Spatial Relationships
**Pattern**: Consistent positioning of interface elements to build muscle memory
- All games maintain fixed layouts that don't change during gameplay
- Critical information always in the same location
- Interaction patterns remain consistent across game states

**AI Agent Application**: Maintain consistent spatial relationships for agent management tools to reduce cognitive load and enable efficient operation.

### 2. Resource Management Dashboards

#### Always-Visible Resource Display
**Pattern**: Critical resources displayed prominently and persistently
- **StarCraft**: Top-right corner for minerals, gas, supply
- **Command & Conquer**: Top of sidebar for credits and power
- **Age of Empires**: Top-center for food, wood, gold, stone, population

**AI Agent Application**: Computational resources (CPU, memory, API quotas, agent capacity) should be constantly visible without interfering with primary workspace.

#### Real-Time Numerical Updates
**Pattern**: Immediate, smooth updates as resources change
- No animation delays that could mask important information
- Clear numerical displays with appropriate precision
- Color coding for status (sufficient/insufficient)

**AI Agent Application**: System resource metrics should update in real-time with clear numerical displays and status indicators.

#### Capacity vs. Usage Indicators
**Pattern**: Clear representation of resource limits and current consumption
- **StarCraft**: Supply as used/total format
- **Command & Conquer**: Power bar showing generation vs. consumption
- **Age of Empires**: Population as current/maximum

**AI Agent Application**: Show both current resource usage and available capacity for all system resources, with clear indicators when approaching limits.

### 3. Selection and Control Mechanisms

#### Multi-Modal Selection
**Pattern**: Multiple ways to select and group units/agents
- Single click for individuals
- Drag selection for groups
- Double-click for type-based selection
- Persistent grouping systems (where available)

**AI Agent Application**: Provide multiple selection methods for agents, including individual selection, group selection, and type-based filtering.

#### Context-Sensitive Commands
**Pattern**: Available actions change based on current selection
- **StarCraft**: Command card adapts to selected unit type
- **Command & Conquer**: Sidebar shows relevant options
- **Age of Empires**: Command panel reflects selection capabilities

**AI Agent Application**: Agent control interfaces should adapt based on selected agent types, showing only relevant commands and configurations.

#### Visual Status Indicators
**Pattern**: Clear visual representation of unit/agent status
- Health bars with color coding (green/yellow/red)
- Activity indicators and progress bars
- Special state indicators (idle, working, etc.)

**AI Agent Application**: Provide clear visual indicators for agent health, activity status, and current tasks.

### 4. Task Orchestration Systems

#### Queue Visualization
**Pattern**: Visual representation of pending tasks and operations
- **StarCraft**: Production queues with progress bars
- **Command & Conquer**: Single-item construction with progress
- **Age of Empires**: Multi-item queues with visual indicators

**AI Agent Application**: Show agent task queues with progress indicators and the ability to modify queue contents.

#### Prerequisites and Dependencies
**Pattern**: Clear indication of requirements for actions
- **StarCraft**: Grayed-out unavailable options
- **Command & Conquer**: Building-based tech progression
- **Age of Empires**: Technology tree with prerequisite chains

**AI Agent Application**: Clearly indicate agent capability requirements and dependencies for different operations.

#### Progress Feedback
**Pattern**: Visual and audio feedback for task completion
- Progress bars for long-running operations
- Audio cues for completion events
- Visual state changes when tasks finish

**AI Agent Application**: Provide clear progress tracking and completion notifications for agent tasks and operations.

### 5. Information Flow and Event Management

#### Priority-Based Alerts
**Pattern**: Different types of events receive appropriate priority
- Combat/critical events highest priority
- Resource warnings medium priority
- Completion notifications lower priority

**AI Agent Application**: Implement priority-based notification system for agent events, with critical system issues taking precedence.

#### Multi-Modal Feedback
**Pattern**: Combination of visual, audio, and text notifications
- Audio alerts for important events
- Visual indicators on overview displays
- Text messages for detailed information

**AI Agent Application**: Use multiple feedback channels to ensure important agent events are noticed without overwhelming the user.

#### Immediate vs. Persistent Information
**Pattern**: Balance between immediate alerts and persistent information
- Critical events get immediate attention
- Status information remains persistently available
- Historical information accessible but not intrusive

**AI Agent Application**: Provide immediate alerts for critical agent events while maintaining persistent access to agent status and historical information.

## Divergent Approaches and Trade-offs

### Interface Layout Philosophy

#### StarCraft: Distributed Layout
- **Approach**: UI elements distributed around screen edges
- **Benefits**: Maximizes central view, familiar to players
- **Trade-offs**: Can feel scattered on wide screens

#### Command & Conquer: Sidebar Concentration
- **Approach**: Vertical sidebar concentrates management functions
- **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, efficient use of vertical space
- **Trade-offs**: Reduces battlefield width

#### Age of Empires: Bottom Panel Integration
- **Approach**: Integrated bottom panel with resource display above
- **Benefits**: Natural reading pattern, comprehensive information display
- **Trade-offs**: Reduces battlefield height

**AI Agent Implications**: Choose layout philosophy based on primary use case - distributed for maximum workspace visibility, sidebar for concentrated control, or integrated panel for comprehensive information display.

### Resource Management Complexity

#### StarCraft: Minimal Resources
- **Approach**: Three simple resources (minerals, gas, supply)
- **Benefits**: Easy to understand and monitor
- **Trade-offs**: Limited strategic depth in resource management

#### Command & Conquer: Power System Innovation
- **Approach**: Credits plus power generation/consumption model
- **Benefits**: Creates interesting capacity management challenges
- **Trade-offs**: Additional complexity in base planning

#### Age of Empires: Multi-Resource Economy
