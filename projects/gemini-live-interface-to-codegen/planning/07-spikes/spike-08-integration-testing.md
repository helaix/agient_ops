    const testAudio = await this.generateTestAudio(scenario.inputText);
    
    // Send audio to system
    const response = await this.sendVoiceInput(testAudio);
    
    // Validate response
    return this.validateVoiceResponse(response, scenario.expectedOutput);
  }
  
  private async generateTestAudio(text: string): Promise<AudioBuffer> {
    // Use TTS to generate consistent test audio
    return await this.textToSpeechService.synthesize(text);
  }
  
  private validateVoiceResponse(response: VoiceResponse, expected: ExpectedResponse): TestResult {
    // Validate transcription accuracy, response content, and timing
    return {
      transcriptionAccuracy: this.calculateAccuracy(response.transcription, expected.text),
      responseRelevance: this.validateResponseContent(response.content, expected.content),

      this.testAPIResponseTimes(),
      this.testConcurrentUsers(),
      this.testResourceUtilization()
    ]);
    
    return this.generatePerformanceReport(results);
  }
  
  private async testVoiceLatency(): Promise<LatencyMetrics> {
    // Measure end-to-end voice processing latency
    const samples = 100;
    const latencies = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < samples; i++) {
      const startTime = Date.now();
      await this.processVoiceInput(this.generateTestAudio());
      latencies.push(Date.now() - startTime);
