## Resilience Patterns and Implementation

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern

```typescript
class CircuitBreaker {
  private state: 'CLOSED' | 'OPEN' | 'HALF_OPEN' = 'CLOSED';
  private failureCount = 0;
  private lastFailureTime = 0;
  
  async execute<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
      if (this.shouldAttemptReset()) {
        this.state = 'HALF_OPEN';
      } else {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is OPEN');
      }
    }
    
    try {
      const result = await operation();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Retry with Exponential Backoff

```typescript
async function retryWithBackoff<T>(
  operation: () => Promise<T>,
  maxRetries: number = 3,
  baseDelay: number = 1000
): Promise<T> {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
      
      const delay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt) + Math.random() * 1000;
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Graceful Degradation

```typescript
class VoiceInterface {
  async processVoiceInput(audio: AudioData): Promise<Response> {
    try {
      // Primary: Gemini Live API
      return await this.geminiAPI.processVoice(audio);
    } catch (error) {
      try {
        // Fallback: Local speech recognition
        return await this.localSTT.process(audio);
      } catch (fallbackError) {
        // Final fallback: Text input mode
        return this.promptForTextInput();
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Health Check and Monitoring

```typescript
class HealthMonitor {
  private healthChecks = new Map<string, HealthCheck>();
  
  async checkSystemHealth(): Promise<HealthStatus> {
    const results = await Promise.allSettled(
      Array.from(this.healthChecks.values()).map(check => check.execute())
    );
    
    return this.aggregateHealthResults(results);
  }
  
  private aggregateHealthResults(results: PromiseSettledResult<any>[]): HealthStatus {
    // Aggregate health check results and determine overall system health
  }
}
```

## Error Communication and User Experience

### Error Message Design Principles
- **Clear and Actionable**: Explain what happened and what the user can do
- **Non-Technical Language**: Avoid technical jargon and error codes
- **Contextual**: Provide relevant information based on the current operation
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show basic message with option for more details
- **Consistent Tone**: Maintain helpful and reassuring tone

### Error Categories for Users
1. **Temporary Issues**: "We're having trouble connecting. Trying again..."
2. **User Action Required**: "Please check your microphone permissions"
3. **Service Unavailable**: "Voice service is temporarily unavailable. You can use text input instead"
4. **Degraded Performance**: "Voice processing is slower than usual. Please be patient"
5. **Critical Errors**: "Something went wrong. Please refresh and try again"

### Fallback Mechanisms
- **Voice to Text**: Switch to text input when voice fails
- **Simplified Interface**: Reduce functionality during degraded states
- **Cached Responses**: Use cached data when services are unavailable
- **Offline Mode**: Limited functionality without network connectivity
- **Manual Override**: Allow users to bypass automated systems
