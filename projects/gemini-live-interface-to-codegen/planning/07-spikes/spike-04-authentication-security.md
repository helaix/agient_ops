2. How should user identity be verified and maintained across sessions?
3. What are the requirements for single sign-on (SSO) integration?
4. How should API credentials be securely managed and rotated?
5. What are the multi-factor authentication requirements?

### Authorization and Access Control
1. How should role-based access control (RBAC) be implemented?
2. What permissions are needed for different user types and operations?
3. How should access to CodeGen and Linear APIs be controlled?
4. What are the requirements for fine-grained permission management?
5. How should temporary access and delegation be handled?

### Security Implementation
1. What encryption standards should be used for data in transit and at rest?
2. How should sensitive data (API keys, tokens) be stored and protected?
3. What are the requirements for audit logging and compliance?
4. How should security vulnerabilities be detected and mitigated?
5. What are the privacy protection and data handling requirements?

## Technical Approaches

### Authentication Methods

#### 1. OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- **Pros**: Industry standard, secure, supports SSO
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, dependency on identity providers
- **Use Cases**: User authentication, third-party integrations
- **Implementation**: Authorization code flow with PKCE

#### 2. JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Pros**: Stateless, scalable, self-contained
- **Cons**: Token revocation challenges, size limitations
- **Use Cases**: API authentication, session management
- **Implementation**: RS256 signing, short expiration times

#### 3. API Key Authentication
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, suitable for service-to-service
- **Cons**: Limited security features, difficult to rotate
- **Use Cases**: Internal API access, webhook authentication
- **Implementation**: HMAC signing, rate limiting

### Authorization Patterns

#### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Pattern**: Users assigned roles with specific permissions
- **Benefits**: Simple to understand and implement
- **Use Cases**: Basic permission management
- **Implementation**: Role hierarchy with permission inheritance

#### 2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- **Pattern**: Access decisions based on attributes and policies
- **Benefits**: Fine-grained control, flexible policies
- **Use Cases**: Complex permission scenarios
- **Implementation**: Policy engine with attribute evaluation

#### 3. Resource-Based Permissions
- **Pattern**: Permissions tied to specific resources
- **Benefits**: Granular control, scalable
- **Use Cases**: Document-level permissions, API endpoint access
- **Implementation**: Resource ownership and sharing models
