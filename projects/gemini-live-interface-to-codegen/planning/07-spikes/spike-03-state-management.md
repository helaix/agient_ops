2. How should conversation context be structured and maintained?
3. What are the optimal patterns for state persistence and recovery?
4. How should state be synchronized across multiple components?
5. What are the scalability requirements for state management?

### Context Preservation
1. How should conversation history be maintained and accessed?
2. What context information is needed for effective function calling?
3. How should user preferences and settings be managed?
4. What are the requirements for cross-session context preservation?
5. How should context be pruned and optimized for performance?

### Technical Implementation
1. What state management libraries or patterns should be used?
2. How should state be stored (memory, database, cache)?
3. What are the requirements for state serialization and deserialization?
4. How should concurrent access to state be handled?
5. What backup and recovery mechanisms are needed?
