- **Knowledge Sharing**: Distribute domain knowledge across the team
- **Bug Prevention**: Catch logic errors and edge cases missed by automated tools
- **Design Validation**: Verify architectural decisions and design patterns
- **Learning**: Provide mentorship and skill development opportunities

### Secondary Goals
- **Consistency**: Maintain coding standards across the codebase
- **Documentation**: Ensure adequate inline and external documentation
- **Performance**: Identify potential performance bottlenecks
- **Security**: Spot security vulnerabilities requiring human judgment

### 3. Review Execution

#### Review Scope
- **Code correctness**: Logic, algorithms, and business rule implementation
- **Design patterns**: Appropriate use of design patterns and architectural principles
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
- **Performance implications**: Potential performance impacts and optimizations
- **Security considerations**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Testability**: Code structure that facilitates testing

- **Functional testing**: Manual testing of new functionality
- **Integration testing**: Verify integration with existing systems
- **Performance testing**: Basic performance validation for critical paths
- **Security testing**: Manual security testing for sensitive operations

## Review Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

#### Readability
- **Clear naming**: Variables, functions, and classes have descriptive names
- **Consistent formatting**: Follows established style guidelines
- **Logical structure**: Code is organized in a logical, easy-to-follow manner
- **Appropriate comments**: Complex logic is well-documented

#### Maintainability
- **Single responsibility**: Functions and classes have single, well-defined purposes
- **DRY principle**: No unnecessary code duplication
- **Modular design**: Code is properly modularized and loosely coupled
- **Refactoring opportunities**: Identify areas for improvement

#### Performance
- **Algorithmic efficiency**: Appropriate algorithms and data structures
- **Resource usage**: Efficient memory and CPU usage
- **Caching strategies**: Appropriate use of caching where beneficial
- **Database queries**: Optimized database interactions

#### Security
- **Input validation**: Proper validation and sanitization of user inputs
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Correct implementation of security controls
- **Data protection**: Sensitive data is properly protected
- **Vulnerability prevention**: Common security vulnerabilities are avoided

### Review Feedback Guidelines

#### Constructive Feedback
- **Specific**: Point to exact lines and provide specific suggestions
- **Actionable**: Provide clear guidance on how to improve
- **Educational**: Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- **Respectful**: Maintain professional and respectful tone
- **Balanced**: Acknowledge good practices alongside suggestions for improvement

#### Feedback Categories
- **Must Fix**: Critical issues that block merge
- **Should Fix**: Important improvements that should be addressed
- **Consider**: Suggestions for potential improvements
- **Nitpick**: Minor style or preference issues
- **Question**: Requests for clarification or discussion

#### Feedback Examples
```markdown
**Must Fix**: This function doesn't handle the case where `user` is null, which could cause a runtime error.

**Should Fix**: Consider extracting this complex logic into a separate function for better readability and testability.

**Consider**: You might want to use a Map instead of an object here for better performance with large datasets.

**Nitpick**: Minor style issue - consider using const instead of let here since the variable isn't reassigned.

**Question**: Can you explain why you chose this approach over the existing pattern used elsewhere in the codebase?
```

## Review Workflow

### 1. Review Request
- Author creates pull request with clear description
- Automated assignment or manual reviewer selection
- Reviewers receive notification and acknowledge assignment

### 2. Initial Review
- Reviewers examine code changes and provide feedback
- Authors address feedback and update pull request
- Discussion and clarification as needed

### 3. Follow-up Reviews
- Reviewers verify that feedback has been addressed
- Additional rounds of review if significant changes are made
- Final approval when all concerns are resolved

### 4. Merge Decision
- All reviewers have approved the changes
- Automated checks have passed
- No outstanding blocking feedback
- Merge performed by author or designated team member

## Review Metrics

### Reviewer Metrics
- **Review turnaround time**: Time from assignment to completion
- **Review thoroughness**: Number of issues identified per review
- **Feedback quality**: Usefulness and actionability of feedback
- **Approval accuracy**: Rate of post-merge issues in approved code

### Author Metrics
- **Self-review effectiveness**: Issues caught before peer review
- **Response time**: Time to address reviewer feedback
- **Code quality**: Rate of issues identified in reviews
