  // Voice Processing
  processVoiceInput(audio: AudioChunk): Promise<VoiceProcessingResult>;
  enhanceAudioQuality(audio: AudioChunk): Promise<AudioChunk>;
  detectVoiceActivity(audio: AudioChunk): Promise<VoiceActivityResult>;
  
  // Conversation Management
  startConversation(context: ConversationContext): Promise<void>;
  handleVoiceCommand(command: VoiceCommand): Promise<CommandResult>;
  manageConversationFlow(state: ConversationState): Promise<FlowAction>;
  endConversation(): Promise<ConversationSummary>;
  
  // User Experience
  provideVoiceFeedback(feedback: VoiceFeedback): Promise<void>;

}

interface AudioCaptureConfig {
  sampleRate: number;
  channels: number;
  echoCancellation: boolean;
  noiseSuppression: boolean;
  autoGainControl: boolean;
  deviceId?: string;
}

interface VoiceCommand {
  transcript: string;
  confidence: number;
  intent: CommandIntent;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  context: ConversationContext;
}

interface VoicePreferences {
  language: string;
  speechRate: number;
  voiceType: 'male' | 'female' | 'neutral';
  confirmationLevel: 'minimal' | 'standard' | 'verbose';
  accessibilityFeatures: AccessibilityFeature[];
}
```

### Core Components
- `AudioManager`: Handles audio input/output and device management

### Performance Requirements
- Audio capture latency: < 20ms
- Voice processing delay: < 100ms
- Response generation time: < 500ms
- Audio playback latency: < 50ms
- End-to-end voice interaction: < 2 seconds
