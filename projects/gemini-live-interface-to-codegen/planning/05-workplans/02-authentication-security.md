# Authentication & Security Workplan

## Pattern Overview
Implementation of comprehensive authentication and security framework for the Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen system, including API key management, user authentication, secure communications, and access control.

## Components

### 1. **User Authentication System**
   * Multi-factor authentication support
   * Session management and token handling
   * OAuth integration for third-party services
   * User identity verification and management

### 2. **API Key Management**
   * Secure storage and rotation of API keys
   * Environment-specific key configuration
   * Key validation and authorization
   * Rate limiting and quota enforcement

### 3. **Secure Communication Layer**
   * End-to-end encryption for voice data
   * HTTPS/WSS enforcement for all communications
   * Certificate management and validation
   * Secure WebSocket connections for real-time data

### 4. **Access Control Framework**
   * Role-based access control (RBAC)
   * Resource-level permissions
   * API endpoint authorization
   * Cross-service authentication

### 5. **Security Monitoring & Auditing**
   * Authentication event logging
   * Security incident detection
   * Audit trail maintenance
   * Compliance reporting capabilities

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. **Preparation Phase**
   * Define security requirements and threat model
   * Design authentication flow and user journey
   * Plan API key storage and rotation strategy
   * Establish security policies and procedures

### 2. **Core Implementation**
   * Implement user authentication system
   * Build API key management infrastructure
   * Create secure communication protocols
   * Develop access control mechanisms

### 3. **Integration Phase**
   * Integrate with Cloudflare security features
   * Connect with state management system
   * Implement cross-service authentication
   * Add security monitoring and logging

### 4. **Hardening Phase**
   * Conduct security testing and penetration testing
   * Implement additional security measures
   * Optimize performance of security operations
   * Document security procedures and incident response

## Prerequisites

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Cloudflare Workers with security features enabled
- [ ] Understanding of OAuth 2.0 and JWT standards
- [ ] Knowledge of encryption and cryptographic principles
- [ ] Experience with TypeScript and Effect TS
- [ ] Familiarity with Cloudflare security tools

### Knowledge Requirements
- [ ] Web application security best practices
- [ ] API security patterns and vulnerabilities
- [ ] Voice data security and privacy requirements
- [ ] Compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC 2, etc.)
- [ ] Incident response and security monitoring

### Dependencies
- [ ] State Management workplan (for session storage)
- [ ] Basic Cloudflare Workers environment
- [ ] External OAuth providers configuration
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate management

## Technical Specifications

### Authentication Architecture
```typescript
interface AuthenticationContext {
  userId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  roles: UserRole[];
  permissions: Permission[];
  tokenExpiry: Date;
  refreshToken?: string;
}

interface APIKeyConfiguration {
  keyId: string;
  service: 'codegen' | 'linear' | 'gemini';
  encryptedKey: string;
  rotationSchedule: string;
  lastRotated: Date;
  permissions: APIPermission[];
}

interface SecurityEvent {
  eventType: 'auth_success' | 'auth_failure' | 'key_rotation' | 'access_denied';
  userId?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
}
```

### Security Components
- `AuthenticationManager`: Handles user login and session management
- `APIKeyVault`: Secure storage and management of API keys
- `AccessControlManager`: Enforces permissions and authorization
- `SecurityAuditor`: Logs and monitors security events
- `EncryptionService`: Handles data encryption and decryption

### Security Requirements
- Authentication token lifetime: 1 hour (with refresh)
- API key rotation: Every 30 days
- Encryption: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Session timeout: 24 hours of inactivity
- Failed login attempts: 5 attempts before lockout

## Testing Strategy

### Security Testing
- [ ] Authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] Authorization escalation testing
- [ ] API key exposure and rotation testing
- [ ] Session hijacking and fixation testing
- [ ] Encryption strength and implementation testing

### Penetration Testing
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment
- [ ] API security testing (OWASP API Security Top 10)
- [ ] Voice data interception attempts
- [ ] Cross-site scripting (XSS) and injection attacks
- [ ] Man-in-the-middle attack simulation

### Compliance Testing
- [ ] GDPR compliance verification
- [ ] Data retention policy enforcement
- [ ] User consent and data deletion
- [ ] Audit log completeness and integrity
- [ ] Privacy policy implementation

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Authentication latency under load
- [ ] Encryption/decryption performance impact
- [ ] API key validation speed
- [ ] Security monitoring overhead
- [ ] Concurrent session handling
