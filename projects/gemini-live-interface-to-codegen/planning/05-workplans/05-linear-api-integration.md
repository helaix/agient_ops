## Technical Specifications

### GraphQL Client Architecture
```typescript
interface LinearClient {
  // Issue Management
  createIssue(input: IssueCreateInput): Promise<Issue>;
  updateIssue(id: string, input: IssueUpdateInput): Promise<Issue>;
  getIssue(id: string): Promise<Issue>;
  listIssues(filter: IssueFilter): Promise<IssueConnection>;
  
  // Project Management
  createProject(input: ProjectCreateInput): Promise<Project>;
  updateProject(id: string, input: ProjectUpdateInput): Promise<Project>;
  getProject(id: string): Promise<Project>;
  listProjects(filter: ProjectFilter): Promise<ProjectConnection>;
  
  // Comments & Communication
  createComment(input: CommentCreateInput): Promise<Comment>;
  updateComment(id: string, input: CommentUpdateInput): Promise<Comment>;
  getComments(issueId: string): Promise<CommentConnection>;
  
  // Workflow Management
  getWorkflowStates(teamId: string): Promise<WorkflowState[]>;
  updateIssueState(issueId: string, stateId: string): Promise<Issue>;
  createCustomWorkflow(input: WorkflowCreateInput): Promise<Workflow>;
}

interface IssueCreateInput {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  teamId: string;
  assigneeId?: string;
  priority?: IssuePriority;
  labelIds?: string[];
  projectId?: string;
  dueDate?: Date;
}

interface VoiceIssueRequest {
  voiceInput: string;
  context: ProjectContext;
  userPreferences: UserPreferences;
  suggestedFields: IssueFieldSuggestions;
}

interface ProjectContext {
  activeProject?: Project;
  team: Team;
  recentIssues: Issue[];
  workflowStates: WorkflowState[];
}
```

### Integration Components
- `LinearGraphQLClient`: Main GraphQL client implementation
- `IssueManager`: Handles issue lifecycle management
- `ProjectTracker`: Manages project and milestone tracking
- `CommentProcessor`: Handles voice-to-comment conversion
- `WorkflowAutomator`: Manages automated workflows

### Performance Requirements
- GraphQL query response: < 300ms for simple queries
- Issue creation: < 1 second end-to-end
- Real-time updates: < 100ms latency
- Voice-to-comment processing: < 2 seconds
- Concurrent operations: 25+ simultaneous requests
