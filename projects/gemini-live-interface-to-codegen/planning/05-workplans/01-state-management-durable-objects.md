# State Management with Durable Objects Workplan

## Pattern Overview
Implementation of centralized state management using Cloudflare Durable Objects to maintain conversation state, project context, and user sessions across the Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen system.

## Components

### 1. **Conversation State Management**
   * Real-time conversation history and context
   * Voice interaction state and audio processing status
   * User intent tracking and conversation flow
   * Session persistence across voice and text interactions

### 2. **Project Context Storage**
   * Active CodeGen projects and task status
   * Linear issue tracking and project metadata
   * User preferences and configuration settings
   * Cross-session project continuity

### 3. **User Session Management**
   * Authentication state and user identity
   * Active connections and session lifecycle
   * Multi-modal interaction coordination
   * Session security and timeout handling

### 4. **API State Coordination**
   * CodeGen API request/response tracking
   * Linear API synchronization state
   * Gemini Live API connection status
   * Rate limiting and quota management

### 5. **Data Persistence Layer**
   * Structured data storage with TypeScript types
   * State serialization and deserialization
   * Backup and recovery mechanisms
   * Data migration and versioning support

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. **Preparation Phase**
   * Define TypeScript interfaces for all state objects
   * Design state schema with Effect TS integration
   * Plan Durable Object namespace organization
   * Establish state lifecycle management patterns

### 2. **Core Implementation**
   * Create base DurableObject class with common functionality
   * Implement conversation state management
   * Build project context storage system
   * Develop user session handling

### 3. **Integration Phase**
   * Connect with authentication system
   * Integrate with API coordination layer
   * Implement state synchronization mechanisms
   * Add monitoring and logging capabilities

### 4. **Optimization Phase**
   * Implement state compression and optimization
   * Add caching layers for frequently accessed data
   * Optimize for low-latency voice interactions
   * Implement state cleanup and garbage collection

## Prerequisites

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Cloudflare Workers environment configured
- [ ] Durable Objects enabled in Cloudflare account
- [ ] TypeScript development environment
- [ ] Effect TS library integration
- [ ] Understanding of Cloudflare Durable Objects API

### Knowledge Requirements
- [ ] Durable Objects lifecycle and limitations
- [ ] State management patterns for real-time applications
- [ ] TypeScript advanced types and interfaces
- [ ] Effect TS state management patterns
- [ ] Cloudflare Workers runtime constraints

### Dependencies
- [ ] Authentication & Security workplan (for user identity)
- [ ] Function Calling Framework workplan (for API coordination)
- [ ] Basic project structure and TypeScript configuration

## Technical Specifications

### State Schema Design
```typescript
interface ConversationState {
  sessionId: string;
  userId: string;
  messages: ConversationMessage[];
  context: ProjectContext;
  voiceState: VoiceInteractionState;
  lastActivity: Date;
}

interface ProjectContext {
  activeProjects: CodeGenProject[];
  linearIssues: LinearIssue[];
  userPreferences: UserPreferences;
  apiStates: APIStateMap;
}

interface VoiceInteractionState {
  isActive: boolean;
  audioStreamId?: string;
  processingStatus: 'idle' | 'listening' | 'processing' | 'responding';
  lastTranscription?: string;
}
```

### Durable Object Classes
- `ConversationManager`: Handles conversation state and history
- `ProjectStateManager`: Manages project context and metadata
- `SessionManager`: Handles user sessions and authentication state
- `APICoordinator`: Tracks API states and rate limiting

### Performance Requirements
- State read operations: < 10ms latency
- State write operations: < 50ms latency
- Concurrent session support: 1000+ active sessions
- State persistence: 24 hours minimum retention
- Memory usage: < 128MB per Durable Object instance

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- [ ] State serialization/deserialization accuracy
- [ ] Conversation history management
- [ ] Session lifecycle handling

- [ ] Error handling and recovery

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Multi-user session isolation
- [ ] Cross-API state synchronization
- [ ] Authentication integration
- [ ] Performance under load
- [ ] State persistence across restarts

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Latency benchmarks for state operations
- [ ] Memory usage profiling
- [ ] Concurrent session handling
- [ ] State cleanup efficiency
- [ ] Network partition recovery

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Voice conversation state continuity
- [ ] Project context preservation
- [ ] Multi-modal interaction coordination
- [ ] Session timeout and recovery
- [ ] Data consistency across components
