   * Function versioning and compatibility management

### 2. **API Orchestration Engine**
   * Intelligent routing between CodeGen, Linear, and Gemini APIs
   * Request/response transformation and mapping
   * Parallel and sequential function execution
   * Context-aware function selection and chaining

### 3. **Error Handling & Resilience**
   * Comprehensive error handling and recovery strategies
   * Circuit breaker patterns for API failures
   * Retry logic with exponential backoff
   * Graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms

### 4. **Response Processing & Formatting**
   * Response aggregation and synthesis
   * Context-aware response formatting
   * Voice-optimized response generation
   * Multi-modal response coordination

### 5. **Monitoring & Analytics**

## Technical Specifications

### Function Calling Architecture
```typescript
interface FunctionDefinition {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  parameters: ParameterSchema;
  apiTarget: 'codegen' | 'linear' | 'gemini' | 'internal';
  category: FunctionCategory;
  requiredPermissions: Permission[];
  estimatedLatency: number;
}

interface FunctionCall {
  functionName: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  context: CallContext;
  priority: 'low' | 'normal' | 'high' | 'urgent';
  timeout: number;
}

interface CallContext {
  userId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  conversationHistory: ConversationMessage[];
  projectContext: ProjectContext;
  voiceInteraction: boolean;
}

interface FunctionResult {
  success: boolean;
  data?: any;
  error?: ErrorDetails;
  metadata: CallMetadata;
  suggestions?: FunctionSuggestion[];
}
```
