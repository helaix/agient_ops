  createAgent(config: AgentConfiguration): Promise<Agent>;
  assignTask(agentId: string, task: Task): Promise<TaskAssignment>;
  getAgentStatus(agentId: string): Promise<AgentStatus>;
  coordinateAgents(workflow: AgentWorkflow): Promise<WorkflowResult>;
  
  // Task Management
  createTask(specification: TaskSpecification): Promise<Task>;
  updateTask(taskId: string, updates: TaskUpdate): Promise<Task>;
  getTaskStatus(taskId: string): Promise<TaskStatus>;
  listTasks(filters: TaskFilters): Promise<Task[]>;
}

interface CodeGenerationRequest {
  prompt: string;
  language: ProgrammingLanguage;
  framework?: string;
  context: ProjectContext;
  requirements: CodeRequirements;
  constraints: CodeConstraints;
}

interface AgentConfiguration {
  type: AgentType;
  capabilities: AgentCapability[];
  resources: ResourceAllocation;
  constraints: AgentConstraints;
}

interface TaskSpecification {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  requirements: Requirement[];
  deliverables: Deliverable[];

- Code generation: < 30 seconds for simple requests
- Agent coordination: < 2 seconds for task assignment
- Status updates: Real-time via WebSocket
- Concurrent requests: 50+ simultaneous operations
