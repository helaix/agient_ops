# Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen - Implementation Workplans (REVISED)

## 🚨 CRITICAL TIMELINE REVISION

**ORIGINAL TIMELINE**: 24 hours (UNREALISTIC)  
**REVISED TIMELINE**: 8-12 weeks for full implementation  
**24-HOUR MVP SCOPE**: Text-only interface with basic function calling

### 24-Hour MVP Limitations
- ✅ Text interface only (no voice processing)
- ✅ Basic authentication (OAuth 2.0)
- ✅ Simple in-memory state management
- ✅ Basic CodeGen and Linear API integration
- ❌ NO voice interface
- ❌ NO Gemini Live API integration
- ❌ NO Durable Objects (use simple storage)

## Success Metrics (REVISED)

The overall project success will be measured by **REALISTIC** criteria:

- [ ] All 9 workplans completed successfully (8-12 weeks)
- [ ] Integration testing passes across all components
