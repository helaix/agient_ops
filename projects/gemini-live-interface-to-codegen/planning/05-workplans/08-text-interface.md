## Technical Specifications

### Text Interface Architecture
```typescript
interface TextInterface {
  // Chat Management
  sendMessage(message: TextMessage): Promise<MessageResult>;
  receiveMessage(message: IncomingMessage): Promise<void>;
  editMessage(messageId: string, content: string): Promise<void>;
  deleteMessage(messageId: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Conversation Management
  createConversation(config: ConversationConfig): Promise<Conversation>;
  joinConversation(conversationId: string): Promise<void>;
  leaveConversation(conversationId: string): Promise<void>;
  getConversationHistory(conversationId: string): Promise<Message[]>;
  
  // Text Processing
  parseTextCommand(text: string): Promise<ParsedCommand>;
  processNaturalLanguage(text: string): Promise<NLUResult>;
  formatResponse(response: any): Promise<FormattedMessage>;
  
  // Multi-modal Integration
  switchToVoiceMode(): Promise<void>;
  convertVoiceToText(audio: AudioData): Promise<string>;
  convertTextToVoice(text: string): Promise<AudioData>;
  syncConversationState(): Promise<void>;
}

interface TextMessage {
  content: string;
  type: 'text' | 'command' | 'code' | 'file';
  metadata: MessageMetadata;
  attachments?: Attachment[];
  formatting?: TextFormatting;
}

interface ConversationConfig {
  type: 'direct' | 'group' | 'project';
  participants: string[];
  settings: ConversationSettings;
  integrations: IntegrationConfig[];
}

interface ParsedCommand {
  command: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  intent: CommandIntent;
  confidence: number;
  suggestions?: CommandSuggestion[];
}
```

### Core Components
- `ChatInterface`: Main chat UI component and framework
- `MessageProcessor`: Handles text processing and command parsing
- `ConversationManager`: Manages conversation state and history
- `MultiModalCoordinator`: Coordinates voice and text interactions
- `NotificationManager`: Handles alerts and push notifications

### Performance Requirements
- Message send/receive latency: < 100ms
- Text processing time: < 200ms
- UI responsiveness: 60fps for smooth interactions
- Large conversation loading: < 2 seconds
- Search and filtering: < 500ms
