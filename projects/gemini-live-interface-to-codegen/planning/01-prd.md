# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-05-22  
**Author:** CodeGen Agent  
**Status:** Draft  

---

## Executive Summary

The Gemini Live Interface to CodeGen project aims to revolutionize how users interact with the CodeGen agentic ecosystem by providing seamless voice and text-based communication through Google's Gemini Live API. This interface will serve as an intelligent overseer, enabling natural conversation-based project management and real-time status reporting.

### Key Value Proposition
Transform CodeGen from a text-based interaction model to a conversational AI assistant that users can speak with naturally, dramatically reducing the friction in managing complex agentic workflows.

---

## 1. Project Vision Statement

### Vision
Create an intelligent conversational interface that serves as the primary command center for the CodeGen agentic ecosystem, enabling users to manage projects, coordinate agents, and receive status updates through natural voice and text interactions.

### Mission
Eliminate the manual overhead of project management in agentic systems by providing an intuitive, voice-first interface that understands context, maintains conversation state, and proactively manages the coordination of multiple AI agents.

### Alignment with CodeGen Ecosystem
This project directly addresses the core challenge of agentic coordination by providing a unified interface that:
- Reduces cognitive load on users managing multiple agents
- Provides real-time visibility into project status
- Enables natural language delegation and oversight
- Maintains context across complex, multi-step workflows

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

**Primary Problem:** Interacting with CodeGen through text-based interfaces is cumbersome and requires significant manual oversight.

**Specific Issues:**
1. **Manual Status Checking**: Users must actively query individual agents or Linear issues to understand project state
2. **Context Switching**: Managing multiple agents requires switching between different interfaces and maintaining mental context
3. **Delayed Feedback**: No proactive notifications or real-time updates on project progress
4. **Coordination Overhead**: Users must manually coordinate between agents, APIs, and project management tools
5. **Accessibility Barriers**: Text-only interaction limits accessibility and natural workflow integration

### Target User Frustrations
- "I want to know project status without having to check multiple places"
- "I need to coordinate agents but it's too manual and time-consuming"
- "I want to talk to my project management system like I would a human assistant"
- "I need real-time updates without constant manual checking"

---

## 3. Solution Overview

### Core Concept
A Gemini-powered conversational interface that acts as an intelligent project manager, capable of:
- Understanding natural language requests about project status
- Proactively providing audio reports on project state
- Coordinating actions across CodeGen and Linear APIs
- Maintaining conversation context and project memory
- Supporting both real-time (voice) and asynchronous (text/Telegram) communication

### Key Innovation
The system will function as an "agentic overseer" - not just responding to queries, but actively monitoring project health, identifying issues, and providing proactive recommendations.

---

## 4. Target Users

### Primary User
**Project Owner/Manager**
- **Profile**: Technical leader managing multiple AI agents and projects
- **Needs**: Real-time project visibility, efficient agent coordination, hands-free status updates
- **Usage Pattern**: Daily check-ins via voice, ad-hoc queries throughout the day
- **Success Metric**: Reduced time spent on manual project management by 70%

### Secondary Users
**Agent Ecosystem Participants**
- **Profile**: Developers and stakeholders who interact with AI agents
- **Needs**: Understanding project context, receiving updates, providing input

### Appendix B: Conversation Examples

**Example 1: Daily Status Check**
```
User: "Good morning, what's happening with my projects today?"

System: "Good morning! Here's your project summary for today:

Your authentication project has 2 updates: PR #123 for the login component was approved and merged this morning. The password reset feature is still blocked - the API team hasn't responded to your request from yesterday.

The mobile app project has 3 active issues. The responsive design fix you created yesterday is now assigned to Sarah and in progress. 

You have one urgent item: the deployment pipeline for the e-commerce project failed overnight. The error appears to be related to environment variables. Would you like me to create an issue for the DevOps team or would you prefer to investigate it yourself?"

User: "Create an issue for DevOps and include the error logs."

System: "I've created issue DEV-789 'Deployment pipeline failure - environment variable error' and assigned it to the DevOps team. I've attached the error logs from last night's failed deployment. The issue is marked as high priority. Is there anything else you'd like me to help with this morning?"
```

**Example 2: Project Deep Dive**
```
User: "Tell me everything about the authentication project."

System: "Here's a comprehensive overview of the authentication project:

Overall Status: 75% complete, on track for next Friday's deadline.

Active Components:
- Login system: Complete and deployed to staging
- Password reset: 60% complete, blocked on API changes
- Two-factor authentication: 40% complete, in active development
- Social login integration: Not started, scheduled for next week

Recent Activity:
- Yesterday: Login component PR was merged after successful code review
- This morning: Password reset API dependency was escalated to backend team
- 2 hours ago: New issue created for OAuth integration testing

Blockers and Risks:
- Password reset API changes are 2 days behind schedule
- OAuth provider approval is pending, could delay social login by 3-5 days

Team Status:
- 3 developers actively working
- 1 developer waiting on API unblocking
- Code review capacity is good, no bottlenecks

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific component or help resolve any of the blockers?"
```

**Example 3: Action Execution**
```
User: "The mobile responsive design is more urgent than I thought. Can you bump its priority and assign more people?"

System: "I'll help you prioritize the mobile responsive design work. Let me check the current assignment...

The issue is currently assigned to Sarah with normal priority. I can:
1. Change priority to high or urgent
2. Assign additional team members
3. Move it to the current sprint if it's in the backlog

Which team members would you like me to add? I see that Mike and Alex from the frontend team are available and have experience with responsive design."

User: "Add Mike and change priority to urgent."

System: "Done! I've updated issue FRONT-456:
- Priority changed from normal to urgent
- Added Mike as an additional assignee alongside Sarah
- Moved the issue to the top of the current sprint
- Added a comment explaining the priority change

I've also notified both Sarah and Mike about the priority change and additional assignment. The issue is now flagged as urgent in the team's dashboard. Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust for this issue?"
```

### Appendix C: Technical Implementation Details

**Effect TS Integration Pattern:**
```typescript
import { Effect, Context, Layer } from "effect"

// Service definitions
interface GeminiService {
  processVoiceInput: (audio: ArrayBuffer) => Effect.Effect<string, GeminiError>
  generateVoiceResponse: (text: string) => Effect.Effect<ArrayBuffer, GeminiError>
}

interface CodeGenService {
  getProjectStatus: (projectId: string) => Effect.Effect<ProjectStatus, APIError>
  executeAction: (action: AgentAction) => Effect.Effect<ActionResult, APIError>
}

interface LinearService {
  createIssue: (issue: IssueCreate) => Effect.Effect<Issue, APIError>
  updateIssue: (id: string, update: IssueUpdate) => Effect.Effect<Issue, APIError>
  getIssues: (filter: IssueFilter) => Effect.Effect<Issue[], APIError>
}
```

**Durable Objects State Management:**
```typescript
export class ConversationState extends DurableObject {
  private state: DurableObjectState
  
  constructor(state: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    this.state = state
  }
  
  async updateContext(userId: string, context: ConversationContext): Promise<void> {
    await this.state.storage.put(`context:${userId}`, context)
  }
  
  async getContext(userId: string): Promise<ConversationContext | null> {
    return await this.state.storage.get(`context:${userId}`) || null
  }
}
```
