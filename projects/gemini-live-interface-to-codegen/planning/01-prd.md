## 1. Project Vision Statement

### Vision
Create an intelligent conversational interface that serves as the primary command center for the CodeGen agentic ecosystem, enabling users to manage projects, coordinate agents, and receive status updates through natural voice and text interactions.

### Mission
Eliminate the manual overhead of project management in agentic systems by providing an intuitive, voice-first interface that understands context, maintains conversation state, and proactively manages the coordination of multiple AI agents.

### Alignment with CodeGen Ecosystem
This project directly addresses the core challenge of agentic coordination by providing a unified interface that:
- Reduces cognitive load on users managing multiple agents
- Provides real-time visibility into project status
- Enables natural language delegation and oversight
- Maintains context across complex, multi-step workflows

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

**Primary Problem:** Interacting with CodeGen through text-based interfaces is cumbersome and requires significant manual oversight.

**Specific Issues:**
1. **Manual Status Checking**: Users must actively query individual agents or Linear issues to understand project state
2. **Context Switching**: Managing multiple agents requires switching between different interfaces and maintaining mental context
3. **Delayed Feedback**: No proactive notifications or real-time updates on project progress
4. **Coordination Overhead**: Users must manually coordinate between agents, APIs, and project management tools
5. **Accessibility Barriers**: Text-only interaction limits accessibility and natural workflow integration

### Target User Frustrations
- "I want to know project status without having to check multiple places"
- "I need to coordinate agents but it's too manual and time-consuming"
- "I want to talk to my project management system like I would a human assistant"
- "I need real-time updates without constant manual checking"

---

## 3. Solution Overview

### Core Concept
A Gemini-powered conversational interface that acts as an intelligent project manager, capable of:
- Understanding natural language requests about project status
- Proactively providing audio reports on project state
- Coordinating actions across CodeGen and Linear APIs
- Maintaining conversation context and project memory
- Supporting both real-time (voice) and asynchronous (text/Telegram) communication

### Key Innovation
The system will function as an "agentic overseer" - not just responding to queries, but actively monitoring project health, identifying issues, and providing proactive recommendations.
