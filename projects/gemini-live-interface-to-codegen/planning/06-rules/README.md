  - Security monitoring and incident response

#### 6. Performance Rules (`performance-rules.md`)
- **Activation**: Performance optimization, scalability, or resource management
- **Coverage**:
  - Response time optimization
  - Resource management
  - Scalability optimization
  - Performance monitoring
  - Caching strategies

### Rule Evaluation and Metrics

#### Rule Evaluation Metrics (`rule-evaluation-metrics.md`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive framework for measuring and improving rule effectiveness
- **Coverage**:
  - Rule activation accuracy
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Quality indicators
  - Compliance criteria
  - Continuous improvement framework

```

## Multi-Rule Scenarios

When a request spans multiple categories, rules are applied in this priority order:

1. **Security Rules** (always highest priority)
2. **Performance Rules** (for optimization concerns)
3. **Integration Rules** (for external dependencies)
4. **Development Rules** (for core implementation)
5. **Testing Rules** (for validation)
6. **Documentation Rules** (for knowledge capture)

## Implementation Guidelines

### For AI Assistants

1. **Rule Selection**: Always start with the master prompt to determine which specialized rules to apply
2. **Context Awareness**: Consider the current project state, user preferences, and conversation history
3. **Quality Assurance**: Apply relevant quality checks from multiple rule categories
4. **Error Handling**: Follow security and performance guidelines even when primary rules fail
5. **Continuous Learning**: Use evaluation metrics to improve rule effectiveness

### For Developers

1. **Rule Updates**: Regularly review and update rules based on system evolution and user feedback
2. **Testing**: Validate rule changes against the evaluation metrics framework
3. **Documentation**: Keep rule documentation synchronized with implementation
4. **Monitoring**: Implement metrics collection to track rule effectiveness
5. **Compliance**: Ensure all rules meet security, privacy, and performance requirements

## Quality Assurance

### Rule Validation Checklist

- [ ] Rule conditions are clearly defined
- [ ] Activation triggers are unambiguous
- [ ] Implementation guidelines are actionable
- [ ] Examples and templates are provided
- [ ] Quality criteria are measurable
- [ ] Security implications are addressed
- [ ] Performance impact is considered
- [ ] Integration points are documented

### Continuous Improvement Process

1. **Metrics Collection**: Continuously gather data on rule effectiveness
2. **Regular Review**: Monthly review of rule performance and user feedback
3. **Optimization**: Implement improvements based on evaluation metrics
4. **Testing**: Validate rule changes in staging environment
5. **Deployment**: Gradual rollout of rule updates with monitoring
6. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect rule changes

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Code Generation Request
```
User: "Create a TypeScript function that validates email addresses"

Rule Activation:
1. Master Prompt → Routes to Development Rules
2. Development Rules → Apply code generation standards
3. Security Rules → Ensure no security vulnerabilities
4. Testing Rules → Include validation tests
5. Documentation Rules → Add proper JSDoc comments
```

### Example 2: Performance Optimization Request
```
User: "Optimize the voice processing pipeline for better response times"

Rule Activation:
1. Master Prompt → Routes to Performance Rules
2. Performance Rules → Apply optimization strategies
3. Integration Rules → Consider API call optimization
4. Testing Rules → Validate performance improvements
5. Documentation Rules → Document optimization decisions
```

### Example 3: Security Review Request
```
