## üîë Key Findings

### Technology Stack Clarity
- **RedwoodSDK vs RedwoodJS**: RedwoodSDK is purpose-built for Cloudflare, eliminating adaptation complexity
- **Native CF Integration**: Built-in support for D1, R2, Queues, and AI Gateway
- **EffectTS Patterns**: Functional programming approach for type-safe error handling and dependency injection

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Monorepo Integration**: Application in `packages/@sparkflow/sparkflow`
2. **Effect-First Server Actions**: All business logic uses Effect patterns
3. **IaC-First Deployment**: Alchemy handles all infrastructure provisioning
4. **Performance Optimization**: Bundle size <1MB, cold start <100ms targets

### Implementation Strategy
- **5-Phase Approach**: Sequential implementation with validation at each step
- **Incremental EffectTS Adoption**: Start simple, gradually introduce complex patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E testing with Effect utilities
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive strategies for identified challenges

## üöÄ Ready for Coder Agent Handoff

### Prepared Resources
- ‚úÖ Complete technical specifications
- ‚úÖ Detailed implementation checklist
- ‚úÖ Architecture diagrams and patterns
- ‚úÖ Risk mitigation strategies
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing strategy
- ‚úÖ Code examples and templates

### Next Steps for Implementation
1. **Environment Setup**: Follow Phase 1 checklist for RedwoodSDK initialization
2. **Cloudflare Configuration**: Implement Phase 2 Workers setup
3. **EffectTS Integration**: Execute Phase 3 Server Action implementation
4. **IaC Deployment**: Complete Phase 4 Alchemy configuration
5. **Verification**: Validate Phase 5 deployment and testing

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ RedwoodSDK application builds and deploys to CF Workers via IaC
- ‚úÖ EffectTS Server Actions execute with proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Frontend renders correctly and Server Actions are callable
- ‚úÖ All tests pass with >90% coverage
- ‚úÖ Performance targets met (bundle <1MB, cold start <100ms)
