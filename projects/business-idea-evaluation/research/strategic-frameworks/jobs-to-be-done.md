# Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

## Overview

Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) is a customer-centric framework developed by Clayton Christensen that focuses on understanding the fundamental "job" customers are trying to accomplish when they "hire" a product or service. It shifts focus from customer demographics to customer motivations and circumstances.

## Framework Description

### Core Concept
When customers buy a product, they essentially "hire" it to get a job done. If it does the job well, they'll hire it again. If it does poorly, they'll "fire" it and look for something else.

### Key Principles

1. **Jobs are Functional, Emotional, and Social**
   - **Functional:** The practical task to be accomplished
   - **Emotional:** How customers want to feel
   - **Social:** How customers want to be perceived

2. **Circumstances Matter More Than Customer Characteristics**
   - Context and situation drive job needs
   - Demographics are less predictive than circumstances

3. **Jobs are Stable, Solutions Change**
   - The fundamental job remains constant
   - Products and services evolve to do the job better

### Job Components

**Job Statement Structure:**
"When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]"

**Example:** "When I'm commuting to work, I want to be productively entertained, so I can feel like I'm making good use of my time."

## High-Leverage Application (80/20 Approach)

### Quick JTBD Analysis (20% effort, 80% customer insight)

**Step 1: Job Identification (10 minutes)**
- What job is the customer trying to get done?
- What triggers the need for this job?
- What does success look like?

**Step 2: Job Mapping (10 minutes)**
- Functional dimension: What task needs completion?
- Emotional dimension: How should they feel?
- Social dimension: How should they be perceived?

**Step 3: Competition Analysis (10 minutes)**
- What are customers currently "hiring" for this job?
- What are they "firing" and why?
- What jobs are underserved or overserved?

## Application Guidelines

### When to Use
✅ **Ideal for:**
- Understanding customer motivations
- Product development and innovation
- Market segmentation
- Identifying unmet needs
- Competitive analysis from customer perspective

### When NOT to Use
❌ **Avoid for:**
- B2B complex organizational decisions
- Highly regulated purchase decisions
- Impulse or emotional purchases
- Technical specification-driven purchases

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Milkshake Study (Original Christensen Research)
**Situation:** Fast-food chain wanted to improve milkshake sales

**Traditional Approach:** Demographics (who buys milkshakes?)
**JTBD Approach:** Circumstances (when and why do people hire milkshakes?)

**Discovery:**
- **Morning Job:** "Keep me full and entertained during my long, boring commute"
- **Afternoon Job:** "Help me be a good parent by treating my child"

**Solutions:**
- Morning: Thicker shakes, faster service, mobile ordering
- Afternoon: Smaller sizes, fun flavors, family experience

### Example 2: IKEA
**Job:** "Help me create a home that reflects my style without spending a fortune"

**Functional:** Furnish living space affordably
**Emotional:** Feel proud of my home, express creativity
**Social:** Appear stylish and resourceful

**IKEA's Solution:** Stylish, affordable furniture with DIY assembly

### Example 3: Uber
**Job:** "Get me from point A to point B reliably and conveniently"

**Functional:** Transportation
**Emotional:** Feel safe, avoid stress of driving/parking
**Social:** Appear modern and efficient

**Uber's Innovation:** On-demand, trackable, cashless transportation

## Implementation Checklist

## Job Mapping Process

### Step 1: Define the Job Executor
- Who is the person trying to get the job done?
- What is their context and situation?
- What constraints do they face?

### Step 2: Map the Job Steps
1. **Define** - How do customers define success?
2. **Locate** - How do they find solutions?
3. **Prepare** - How do they prepare to use solutions?
4. **Confirm** - How do they confirm the solution will work?
5. **Execute** - How do they use the solution?
6. **Monitor** - How do they monitor success?
7. **Modify** - How do they modify for better results?
8. **Conclude** - How do they conclude the job is done?

### Step 3: Identify Pain Points
- Where do customers struggle in the job process?
- What causes frustration or inefficiency?
- Where do current solutions fall short?

## Customer Interview Guide

### Opening Questions
- "Tell me about the last time you [relevant situation]"
- "Walk me through what you were trying to accomplish"
- "What was going on in your life at that time?"

### Job Exploration Questions
- "What were you hoping to achieve?"
- "How did you go about solving this?"
- "What alternatives did you consider?"
- "What almost stopped you from moving forward?"

### Outcome Questions
- "How did you know you were successful?"
- "What would have made it better?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"

### Emotional/Social Questions
- "How did it make you feel when..."
- "What did others think about your choice?"
- "What was most important to you in this situation?"

## Common Job Categories

### Functional Jobs
- **Get from A to B** (transportation)
- **Stay informed** (news, updates)
- **Accomplish task** (productivity tools)
- **Maintain health** (fitness, nutrition)

### Emotional Jobs
- **Feel confident** (education, coaching)
- **Feel entertained** (media, games)
- **Feel secure** (insurance, savings)
- **Feel connected** (social platforms)

### Social Jobs
- **Appear successful** (luxury goods)
- **Appear caring** (gifts, donations)
- **Appear knowledgeable** (information services)
- **Appear responsible** (sustainable products)

## Limitations and Warnings

### Framework Limitations
⚠️ **Individual Focus:** Better for B2C than complex B2B decisions
⚠️ **Rational Assumption:** Assumes customers can articulate their jobs
⚠️ **Static View:** Jobs can evolve with technology and culture
⚠️ **Implementation Gap:** Knowing the job doesn't guarantee solution success

### Common Pitfalls
- Confusing features with jobs
- Focusing only on functional dimensions
- Assuming all customers have the same job
- Ignoring the importance of circumstances

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### Complementary Frameworks
- **Blue Ocean Strategy:** Use JTBD to identify uncontested market spaces
- **Business Model Canvas:** Apply job insights to value propositions
- **Lean Startup:** Test job hypotheses with MVPs

### Sequential Application
1. **Jobs-to-be-Done** → Understand customer motivations
2. **Blue Ocean Strategy** → Find uncontested ways to do the job
3. **Business Model Canvas** → Design business model around the job
4. **Lean Startup** → Validate job-solution fit

## Advanced JTBD Concepts

### Job Hierarchies
- **Big Jobs:** Life-changing objectives (find career, buy home)
- **Small Jobs:** Daily tasks (commute, eat lunch)
- **Micro Jobs:** Moment-to-moment needs (check time, find keys)

### Job Frequency vs. Importance Matrix
```
High Frequency, High Importance: Prime opportunities
High Frequency, Low Importance: Efficiency plays
Low Frequency, High Importance: Premium solutions
Low Frequency, Low Importance: Avoid or bundle
```

### Outcome-Driven Innovation
Focus on the outcomes customers want to achieve, not the solutions they currently use.
