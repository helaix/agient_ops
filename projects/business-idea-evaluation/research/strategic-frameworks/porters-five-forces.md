# Porter's Five Forces Framework

## Overview

Porter's Five Forces is a strategic framework developed by Michael E. Porter of Harvard Business School for analyzing the competitive environment and industry attractiveness. It provides a systematic approach to understanding the forces that shape competition within an industry.

## Framework Description

The framework examines five key forces that determine competitive intensity and industry profitability:

### 1. Threat of New Entrants
**What it measures:** How easy or difficult it is for new competitors to enter the market

**Key factors:**
- Barriers to entry (capital requirements, regulations, patents)
- Economies of scale
- Brand loyalty and switching costs
- Access to distribution channels
- Government policies

### 2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers
**What it measures:** How much control suppliers have over pricing and terms

**Key factors:**
- Number of suppliers available
- Uniqueness of supplier products/services
- Switching costs for changing suppliers
- Supplier concentration vs. industry concentration
- Forward integration potential

### 3. Bargaining Power of Buyers
**What it measures:** How much influence customers have on pricing and terms

**Key factors:**
- Buyer concentration vs. industry concentration
- Volume of purchases
- Switching costs for buyers
- Availability of substitute products
- Price sensitivity

### 4. Threat of Substitute Products/Services
**What it measures:** How easily customers can find alternative solutions

**Key factors:**
- Availability of close substitutes
- Relative price performance of substitutes
- Switching costs
- Buyer propensity to substitute

### 5. Competitive Rivalry
**What it measures:** Intensity of competition among existing players

**Key factors:**
- Number and size of competitors
- Industry growth rate
- Product differentiation
- Exit barriers
- Fixed costs structure

## High-Leverage Application (80/20 Approach)

### Quick Assessment Method (20% effort, 80% insight)

**Step 1: Rapid Industry Scan (15 minutes)**
- Identify 3-5 key competitors
- Note obvious barriers to entry
- List main suppliers and customers

**Step 2: Force Scoring (10 minutes)**
Rate each force on a scale of 1-5 (1 = low threat/power, 5 = high threat/power):
- New entrants: ___/5
- Supplier power: ___/5
- Buyer power: ___/5
- Substitutes: ___/5
- Rivalry: ___/5

**Step 3: Strategic Implications (5 minutes)**
- Total score 5-12: Attractive industry
- Total score 13-20: Moderate attractiveness
- Total score 21-25: Unattractive industry

## Application Guidelines

### When to Use
✅ **Ideal for:**
- Industry attractiveness assessment
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Strategic positioning decisions
- Investment evaluation
- Market entry decisions

### When NOT to Use
❌ **Avoid for:**
- Rapidly changing/emerging industries
- Platform/network effect businesses
- Early-stage market validation
- Internal capability assessment

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Startup
**Industry:** Customer Relationship Management Software

**Quick Assessment:**
- **New Entrants (4/5):** Low barriers, many new SaaS companies entering
- **Supplier Power (2/5):** Cloud infrastructure commoditized
- **Buyer Power (3/5):** Many alternatives, but switching costs exist
- **Substitutes (4/5):** Excel, other CRM solutions, custom builds
- **Rivalry (5/5):** Intense competition (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)

**Total Score:** 18/25 (Moderate attractiveness)
**Strategic Implication:** Need strong differentiation and niche focus

### Example 2: Local Restaurant
**Industry:** Fast-Casual Dining

**Quick Assessment:**
- **New Entrants (3/5):** Moderate barriers (location, permits, capital)
- **Supplier Power (2/5):** Many food suppliers available
- **Buyer Power (4/5):** Many dining options, low switching costs
- **Substitutes (5/5):** Delivery apps, grocery stores, other restaurants
- **Rivalry (4/5):** High local competition

**Total Score:** 18/25 (Moderate attractiveness)
**Strategic Implication:** Location and unique value proposition critical

## Implementation Checklist

## Limitations and Warnings

### Framework Limitations
⚠️ **Static Analysis:** Provides snapshot, not dynamic view
⚠️ **Industry Focus:** Less useful for platform/ecosystem businesses
⚠️ **Established Markets:** Better for mature industries than emerging ones
⚠️ **External Focus:** Doesn't assess internal capabilities

### Common Pitfalls
- Defining industry boundaries too narrowly or broadly
- Focusing only on direct competitors
- Ignoring potential future changes
- Over-weighting current competitive dynamics

## Integration with Other Frameworks

### Complementary Frameworks
- **Blue Ocean Strategy:** Use after Porter's to find uncontested spaces
- **Business Model Canvas:** Apply Porter's insights to competitive advantage
- **Jobs-to-be-Done:** Validate Porter's assumptions about customer needs

### Sequential Application
1. **Porter's Five Forces** → Industry attractiveness
2. **Blue Ocean Strategy** → Market creation opportunities
3. **Business Model Canvas** → Business model design
4. **Lean Startup** → Validation and testing
