# Blue Ocean Strategy Framework

## Overview

Blue Ocean Strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, is a strategic framework focused on creating uncontested market space through value innovation. Instead of competing in existing markets (red oceans), it guides organizations to create new markets (blue oceans) where competition is irrelevant.

## Framework Description

### Core Concept: Value Innovation
**Value Innovation** is the cornerstone of Blue Ocean Strategy - the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost to create a leap in value for both buyers and the company.

### Red Ocean vs Blue Ocean

| Red Ocean Strategy | Blue Ocean Strategy |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Compete in existing market space | Create uncontested market space |
| Beat the competition | Make competition irrelevant |
| Exploit existing demand | Create and capture new demand |
| Make value-cost trade-off | Break value-cost trade-off |
| Align activities with strategic choice of differentiation OR low cost | Align activities in pursuit of differentiation AND low cost |

## Key Tools and Frameworks

### 1. Strategy Canvas
**Purpose:** Visual representation of current competitive landscape and identification of blue ocean opportunities

**Components:**
- **Horizontal axis:** Competing factors the industry invests in
- **Vertical axis:** Level of offering buyers receive
- **Value curves:** Lines showing how companies perform across factors

### 2. Four Actions Framework
**Purpose:** Reconstruct buyer value elements to create new value curves

**Four Questions:**
1. **Eliminate:** Which factors should be eliminated that the industry takes for granted?
2. **Reduce:** Which factors should be reduced well below industry standard?
3. **Raise:** Which factors should be raised well above industry standard?
4. **Create:** Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?

### 3. ERRC Grid (Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create)
**Purpose:** Systematic tool to apply the Four Actions Framework

```
ELIMINATE          | REDUCE
What to remove     | What to minimize
entirely          | below industry norm
__________________|__________________
CREATE            | RAISE  
What to add that  | What to maximize
never existed     | above industry norm
```

### 4. Six Paths Framework
**Purpose:** Systematic approach to finding blue ocean opportunities

1. **Look across alternative industries**
2. **Look across strategic groups within industry**
3. **Look across chain of buyers**
4. **Look across complementary products/services**
5. **Look across functional/emotional appeal**
6. **Look across time**

## High-Leverage Application (80/20 Approach)

### Quick Blue Ocean Assessment (20% effort, 80% insight)

**Step 1: Current State Mapping (10 minutes)**
- List 6-8 key competing factors in your industry
- Rate your solution vs. top 3 competitors (1-5 scale)
- Draw simple value curves

**Step 2: Four Actions Analysis (15 minutes)**
- Eliminate: What can you remove that adds cost but no value?
- Reduce: What can you do less of than competitors?
- Raise: What can you excel at beyond industry standards?
- Create: What new factors can you introduce?

**Step 3: Blue Ocean Potential (5 minutes)**
- Does your new value curve differ significantly from competitors?
- Do you break the value-cost trade-off?
- Is there a compelling tagline that captures the shift?

## Application Guidelines

### When to Use
✅ **Ideal for:**
- Saturated, competitive markets
- Commoditized industries
- New product/service development
- Market expansion strategies
- Differentiation challenges

### When NOT to Use
❌ **Avoid for:**
- Completely new/undefined markets
- Regulated industries with fixed parameters
- Resource-constrained situations requiring focus
- Short-term tactical decisions

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Cirque du Soleil
**Industry:** Circus Entertainment

**Traditional Circus Factors:**
- Star performers, animal shows, aisle concessions, multiple show arenas

**Blue Ocean Innovation:**
- **Eliminated:** Animal shows, star performers, aisle concessions
- **Reduced:** Humor and danger, multiple arenas
- **Raised:** Unique venue, artistic music and dance
- **Created:** Theme, refined environment, multiple productions

**Result:** Created new market space combining circus and theater

### Example 2: Southwest Airlines
**Industry:** Airline Transportation

**Traditional Airline Factors:**
- Meals, lounges, seating choices, hub connectivity

**Blue Ocean Innovation:**
- **Eliminated:** Meals, lounges, seating assignments, hub connectivity
- **Reduced:** Price, service complexity
- **Raised:** Flight frequency, speed, friendly service
- **Created:** Point-to-point travel, fun flying experience

**Result:** Made flying accessible to bus and car travelers

### Example 3: Netflix (Original Model)
**Industry:** Video Rental

**Traditional Video Store Factors:**
- Physical locations, late fees, limited selection, browsing experience

**Blue Ocean Innovation:**
- **Eliminated:** Late fees, physical stores, limited selection
- **Reduced:** Price per rental
- **Raised:** Convenience, selection variety
- **Created:** Mail delivery, subscription model, recommendation engine

**Result:** Transformed video rental into subscription service

## Six Paths Exploration Guide

### Path 1: Alternative Industries
**Question:** What industries do customers turn to when they can't use yours?
**Example:** Starbucks looked at fast food, not just coffee shops

### Path 2: Strategic Groups
**Question:** What different approaches exist within your industry?
**Example:** Curves looked at male-oriented gyms vs. home exercise

### Path 3: Chain of Buyers
**Question:** Who are the influencers, purchasers, and users?
**Example:** Novo Nordisk focused on patients, not just doctors

### Path 4: Complementary Offerings
**Question:** What happens before, during, and after your product is used?
**Example:** NABI focused on total bus solution, not just manufacturing

### Path 5: Functional-Emotional Appeal
**Question:** Can you shift from functional to emotional or vice versa?
**Example:** Swatch made watches emotional fashion statements

### Path 6: Time Trends
**Question:** What trends will shape your industry over time?
**Example:** Apple anticipated mobile internet convergence
