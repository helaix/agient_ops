### Worksheet 2: Framework Alignment Check

```
FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT

CUSTOMER JOB ↔ VALUE PROPOSITION
Does your value proposition directly address the core customer job?
□ Strong alignment □ Moderate alignment □ Weak alignment

BLUE OCEAN ↔ BUSINESS MODEL
Does your business model support the blue ocean strategy?
□ Strong alignment □ Moderate alignment □ Weak alignment

VALIDATION ↔ ASSUMPTIONS
Are you testing the most critical business model assumptions?
□ Strong alignment □ Moderate alignment □ Weak alignment

COMPETITIVE POSITION ↔ DIFFERENTIATION
Does your competitive analysis support your differentiation strategy?
□ Strong alignment □ Moderate alignment □ Weak alignment

OVERALL COHERENCE
Do all frameworks point to the same strategic direction?
□ Highly coherent □ Mostly coherent □ Conflicting signals

ACTION ITEMS
If alignment is weak, what needs to be adjusted?

## Common Integration Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Framework Conflicts
**Problem:** Different frameworks suggest different strategies
**Solution:** 
- Prioritize customer insights (JTBD) as foundation
- Use conflicts to identify hidden assumptions
- Test conflicting hypotheses with Lean Startup methods

### Challenge 2: Analysis Paralysis
**Problem:** Too much analysis, not enough action
**Solution:**
- Set strict time limits for each framework
- Focus on key insights, not comprehensive analysis
- Move to validation quickly

### Challenge 3: Confirmation Bias
**Problem:** Using frameworks to confirm existing beliefs
**Solution:**
- Actively look for disconfirming evidence
- Involve external perspectives
- Use Lean Startup to test assumptions objectively

### Challenge 4: Context Misalignment
**Problem:** Applying frameworks inappropriately
**Solution:**
- Consider industry and business context
- Adapt frameworks to specific situations
- Skip frameworks that don't add value
