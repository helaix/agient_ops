## STEEP Analysis (Simplified Framework)

### When to Use STEEP vs. PESTLE
- **STEEP** (Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political) - Simpler, faster analysis
- **PESTLE** - More comprehensive, includes legal factors separately
- **STEEPLE** - Adds ethical factors for additional consideration

### STEEP Analysis Process

1. **Identify Key Factors** in each category
2. **Assess Impact** (High/Medium/Low) on business
3. **Evaluate Likelihood** of occurrence
4. **Determine Timing** of potential impacts
5. **Develop Response Strategies** for key factors

## Practical Assessment Tools

### 1. PESTLE Analysis Template

**Factor Assessment Matrix:**

| Category | Factor | Impact (1-5) | Likelihood (1-5) | Timing | Response Strategy |
|----------|--------|--------------|------------------|--------|-------------------|
| Political | Regulatory change | 4 | 3 | 12 months | Monitor, prepare compliance |
| Economic | Interest rate rise | 3 | 4 | 6 months | Secure fixed-rate financing |
| Social | Demographic shift | 2 | 5 | 24 months | Adjust target market |
| Technological | AI disruption | 5 | 3 | 18 months | Invest in AI capabilities |
| Legal | Privacy regulation | 4 | 4 | 12 months | Implement privacy controls |
| Environmental | Carbon regulations | 3 | 4 | 24 months | Develop sustainability plan |

**Impact Scale:**
- 5: Critical impact on business viability
- 4: Major impact on operations or strategy
- 3: Moderate impact requiring attention
- 2: Minor impact with limited consequences
- 1: Minimal impact on business

**Likelihood Scale:**
- 5: Very likely (>80% probability)
- 4: Likely (60-80% probability)
- 3: Possible (40-60% probability)
- 2: Unlikely (20-40% probability)
- 1: Very unlikely (<20% probability)
