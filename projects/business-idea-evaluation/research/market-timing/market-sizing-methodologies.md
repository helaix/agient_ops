# Market Sizing Methodologies: TAM, SAM, SOM

## Overview

Market sizing using TAM (Total Addressable Market), SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market), and SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) provides a structured approach to understanding market opportunity and setting realistic growth expectations.

## Framework Definitions

### TAM (Total Addressable Market)
**Definition:** The total revenue opportunity available if a product could achieve 100% market share with no constraints.

**Characteristics:**
- Represents the theoretical maximum revenue potential
- Includes all potential customers globally
- Unconstrained by geography, competition, or implementation
- Answers: "How large is the entire economic opportunity?"

### SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
**Definition:** The portion of TAM that can realistically be reached given business model constraints.

**Characteristics:**
- Constrained by geographic reach, business model, regulatory factors
- Represents the addressable market for your specific solution
- More realistic than TAM but still optimistic
- Answers: "What portion of the market can we actually serve?"

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
**Definition:** The portion of SAM that can realistically be captured given competition and execution capabilities.

**Characteristics:**
- Most realistic and conservative estimate
- Accounts for competition, market share limitations, execution constraints
- Represents near-term achievable market
- Answers: "What can we realistically capture?"

## Calculation Methodologies

### Top-Down Approach

**Method:** Start with large market data and narrow down through filters

**Steps:**
1. **Identify Total Market Size** (TAM)
   - Use industry reports, government data, research studies
   - Calculate: Total market value or total potential customers

2. **Apply Geographic Filters** (SAM)
   - Narrow to addressable geographies
   - Consider regulatory restrictions, language barriers

3. **Apply Business Model Filters** (SAM)
   - Consider customer segments you can serve
   - Account for distribution channel limitations

4. **Apply Competitive Reality** (SOM)
   - Estimate realistic market share (typically 1-10% for new entrants)
   - Consider competitive advantages and barriers

**Example:**
```
TAM: Global CRM Software Market = $50B
SAM: English-speaking SMB market = $15B (30% of TAM)
SOM: Realistic capture in 5 years = $150M (1% of SAM)
```

### Bottom-Up Approach

**Method:** Build market size from customer segments and unit economics

**Steps:**
1. **Define Customer Segments**
   - Identify specific customer types
   - Estimate number of customers in each segment

2. **Calculate Revenue per Customer**
   - Estimate annual revenue per customer
   - Consider different pricing tiers

3. **Build Market Size**
   - Multiply customers × revenue per customer
   - Aggregate across segments

**Example:**
```
Segment 1: 10,000 small businesses × $1,200/year = $12M
Segment 2: 2,000 medium businesses × $5,000/year = $10M
Segment 3: 200 large businesses × $25,000/year = $5M
Total SOM = $27M
```

### Hybrid Approach

**Method:** Combine top-down and bottom-up for validation

**Benefits:**
- Cross-validates estimates
- Provides confidence ranges
- Identifies gaps in analysis

## Data Sources and Research Methods

   - Validate willingness to pay
   - Understand buying processes
   - Estimate budget allocations

2. **Surveys**
   - Quantify market demand
   - Segment customer preferences
   - Validate pricing assumptions

3. **Expert Interviews**
   - Industry analysts and consultants
   - Former executives from target companies
   - Channel partners and distributors

### Secondary Research
1. **Industry Reports**
   - Gartner, Forrester, IDC
   - McKinsey, BCG, Bain studies
   - Trade association reports

2. **Government Data**
   - Census data, economic statistics
   - Regulatory filings and databases
   - Trade and commerce departments

3. **Financial Data**
   - Public company financials
   - Industry benchmarks
   - Venture capital databases

4. **Online Sources**
   - Google Trends, keyword research
   - Social media analytics
   - Web traffic analysis

## Calculation Examples

### SaaS Business Example

**TAM Calculation:**
```
Global businesses with 10+ employees: 50M
Average software spend per business: $10,000/year
TAM = 50M × $10,000 = $500B
```

**SAM Calculation:**
```
English-speaking markets: 15M businesses (30% of TAM)
Businesses using cloud software: 12M (80% of English-speaking)
Average spend on productivity tools: $2,000/year
SAM = 12M × $2,000 = $24B
```

**SOM Calculation:**
```
Target segment (SMBs 50-500 employees): 2M businesses
Realistic penetration in 5 years: 1% = 20,000 customers
Average revenue per customer: $3,000/year
SOM = 20,000 × $3,000 = $60M
```

### E-commerce Platform Example

**Bottom-Up SOM:**
```
Small retailers (0-$1M revenue): 100,000 × $100/month = $120M/year
Medium retailers ($1M-$10M): 20,000 × $500/month = $120M/year
Large retailers ($10M+): 2,000 × $2,000/month = $48M/year
Total SOM = $288M/year
```

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Overestimation Errors
1. **Using TAM as Addressable Market**
   - Problem: Ignoring practical constraints
   - Solution: Always calculate SAM and SOM

2. **Assuming High Market Share**
   - Problem: Unrealistic penetration assumptions
   - Solution: Research typical market shares for new entrants

3. **Ignoring Competition**
   - Problem: Assuming empty market
   - Solution: Account for existing and future competition

### Underestimation Errors
1. **Too Narrow Market Definition**
   - Problem: Missing adjacent opportunities
   - Solution: Consider broader problem space

2. **Conservative Growth Assumptions**
   - Problem: Missing market expansion
   - Solution: Model multiple growth scenarios

### Data Quality Issues
1. **Outdated Information**
   - Problem: Using old market data
   - Solution: Use most recent data available

2. **Inconsistent Sources**
   - Problem: Mixing incompatible data sets
   - Solution: Validate across multiple sources

## Validation Techniques

### Sanity Checks
