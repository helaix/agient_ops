### Basic Information

**Business/Product:** ________________________________
**Target Market:** ___________________________________
**Geographic Focus:** ________________________________
**Analysis Date:** ___________________________________
**Analyst:** ________________________________________

## Method 1: Top-Down Approach

### Step 1: Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**Data Sources Used:**
- [ ] Industry reports (Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
- [ ] Government statistics
- [ ] Trade association data
- [ ] Market research firms
- [ ] Public company data

**TAM Calculation:**

**Option A: Market Value Approach**
```
Total Industry Market Size: $________________
Source: _____________________________________
Year: ______________________________________
Growth Rate: _______________________________%

TAM = Total Industry Market Size
TAM = $________________
```

**Option B: Customer Volume Approach**
```
Total Potential Customers: __________________
Average Revenue per Customer: $______________
Source for customer count: __________________
Source for revenue data: ____________________

TAM = Total Customers × Average Revenue
TAM = ________________ × $________________
TAM = $________________
```

### Step 2: Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

**Geographic Filters:**
```
TAM: $________________
Geographic Coverage: ____________________%
(e.g., English-speaking markets = 30% of global)

Geographic SAM = TAM × Geographic %
Geographic SAM = $________________ × ____%
Geographic SAM = $________________
```

**Customer Segment Filters:**
```
Geographic SAM: $________________
Target Customer Segments: ________________%
(e.g., SMB segment = 40% of total market)

Segment SAM = Geographic SAM × Segment %
Segment SAM = $________________ × ____%
Segment SAM = $________________
```

**Business Model Filters:**
```
Segment SAM: $________________
Business Model Addressable: _______________% 
(e.g., SaaS model = 60% of software market)

Final SAM = Segment SAM × Business Model %
Final SAM = $________________ × ____%
Final SAM = $________________
```

### Step 3: Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**Market Share Approach:**
```
SAM: $________________
Realistic Market Share (Year 5): ___________%
(Typical range: 1-10% for new entrants)

SOM = SAM × Market Share %
SOM = $________________ × ____%
SOM = $________________
```

**Competitive Reality Check:**
```
Number of Major Competitors: _______________
Average Market Share of Top 5: ____________%
Remaining Market Share Available: __________%
Your Realistic Capture: ____________________%

Competitive SOM = SAM × Realistic Capture %
Competitive SOM = $________________ × ____%
Competitive SOM = $________________
```

## Method 2: Bottom-Up Approach

### Customer Segment Analysis

**Segment 1:**
```
Segment Name: ______________________________
Number of Customers: _______________________
Average Annual Revenue: $___________________
Penetration Rate (Year 5): __________________%

Segment 1 Revenue = Customers × Revenue × Penetration
Segment 1 Revenue = _______ × $_______ × ____%
Segment 1 Revenue = $______________________
```

**Segment 2:**
```
Segment Name: ______________________________
Number of Customers: _______________________
Average Annual Revenue: $___________________
Penetration Rate (Year 5): __________________%

Segment 2 Revenue = Customers × Revenue × Penetration
Segment 2 Revenue = _______ × $_______ × ____%
Segment 2 Revenue = $______________________
```

**Segment 3:**
```
Segment Name: ______________________________
Number of Customers: _______________________
Average Annual Revenue: $___________________
Penetration Rate (Year 5): __________________%

Segment 3 Revenue = Customers × Revenue × Penetration
Segment 3 Revenue = _______ × $_______ × ____%
Segment 3 Revenue = $______________________
```

**Total Bottom-Up SOM:**
```
Total SOM = Segment 1 + Segment 2 + Segment 3 + ...
Total SOM = $_______ + $_______ + $_______ + ...
Total SOM = $______________________________
```

## Method 3: Hybrid Validation

### Cross-Validation Analysis

**Top-Down Results:**
- TAM: $________________
- SAM: $________________
- SOM: $________________

**Bottom-Up Results:**
- SOM: $________________

**Variance Analysis:**
```
Difference = |Top-Down SOM - Bottom-Up SOM|
Difference = |$_______ - $_______| = $_______
Percentage Difference = (Difference ÷ Average) × 100
Percentage Difference = _______%
```

**Acceptable Variance:** <30% (if higher, investigate assumptions)

### Reconciliation Process

**If Variance >30%:**
- [ ] Review customer count assumptions
- [ ] Validate pricing assumptions
- [ ] Check market size data sources
- [ ] Reassess penetration rates
- [ ] Verify geographic/segment filters

**Reconciled Estimates:**
- TAM: $________________
- SAM: $________________
- SOM: $________________

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Competition
**Problem:** Calculating SOM without considering competitive dynamics
**Solution:** Factor in existing and future competition

### Pitfall 4: Static Analysis
**Problem:** Using current market size without growth projections
**Solution:** Include market growth rates and time-based analysis

### Pitfall 5: Inconsistent Data Sources
