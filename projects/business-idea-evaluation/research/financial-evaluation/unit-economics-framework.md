# Unit Economics Assessment Framework

## Overview

Unit economics provide the foundation for understanding business viability by analyzing the profitability of individual customers or transactions. This framework synthesizes proven methodologies from leading venture capital firms and successful startups to create a comprehensive assessment tool.

## Core Unit Economics Metrics

### 1. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

#### Definition
The total revenue expected from a customer over their entire relationship with the business.

#### Calculation Methods

**Method 1: Simple LTV (Quick Assessment)**
```
LTV = Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) × Customer Lifespan
```

**Method 2: Cohort-Based LTV (Detailed Analysis)**
```
LTV = (Monthly Revenue per Customer × Gross Margin %) / Monthly Churn Rate
```

**Method 3: Predictive LTV (Advanced)**
```
LTV = Σ(Revenue_month_n × Retention_rate_n × Gross_margin_n) / (1 + Discount_rate)^n
```

#### Industry Benchmarks
- **SaaS**: $1,000 - $100,000+ depending on segment
- **E-commerce**: $50 - $500 for consumer, $1,000+ for B2B
- **Marketplace**: Varies by category, typically $100 - $1,000
- **Subscription**: $200 - $2,000 depending on price point

### 2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

#### Definition
The total cost to acquire a new paying customer, including all sales and marketing expenses.

#### Calculation
```
CAC = (Sales Expenses + Marketing Expenses) / Number of New Customers Acquired
```

#### Components to Include
- **Sales Team Costs**: Salaries, commissions, benefits
- **Marketing Spend**: Advertising, content, events, tools
- **Overhead Allocation**: Portion of general expenses
- **Technology Costs**: CRM, marketing automation, analytics

#### CAC by Channel Analysis
Track CAC separately for each acquisition channel:
- Paid advertising (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Content marketing and SEO
- Sales development (SDR/BDR)
- Referrals and word-of-mouth
- Partnerships and integrations

### 3. LTV/CAC Ratio

#### Target Ratios by Business Type
- **SaaS**: 3:1 minimum, 5:1+ excellent
- **E-commerce**: 2:1 minimum, 4:1+ excellent
- **Marketplace**: 3:1 minimum, 6:1+ excellent
- **Hardware**: 2:1 minimum, 3:1+ excellent

#### Ratio Interpretation
- **>5:1**: Excellent, consider increasing marketing spend
- **3-5:1**: Good, sustainable business model
- **2-3:1**: Acceptable, monitor closely
- **<2:1**: Concerning, requires immediate attention

### 4. Payback Period

#### Definition
Time required to recover the customer acquisition cost through gross margin.

#### Calculation
```
Payback Period = CAC / (Monthly Revenue per Customer × Gross Margin %)
```

#### Target Benchmarks
- **SaaS**: 6-12 months
- **E-commerce**: 3-6 months
- **Subscription**: 6-18 months
- **Enterprise**: 12-24 months

### 5. Gross Margin Analysis

#### Calculation
```
Gross Margin % = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue × 100
```

#### Cost Components by Business Type

**SaaS Business**
- Hosting and infrastructure
- Customer support
- Payment processing
- Third-party integrations

**E-commerce Business**
- Product costs
- Shipping and fulfillment
- Payment processing
- Returns and refunds

**Marketplace Business**
- Platform operations
- Payment processing
- Customer support
- Trust and safety

#### Target Gross Margins
- **SaaS**: 70-90%
- **E-commerce**: 30-60%
- **Marketplace**: 60-80%
- **Hardware**: 20-40%

## Cohort Analysis Framework

### 1. Cohort Definition

#### Time-Based Cohorts
- Monthly acquisition cohorts
- Quarterly cohorts for longer sales cycles
- Weekly cohorts for high-volume businesses

#### Behavioral Cohorts
- Acquisition channel cohorts
- Customer segment cohorts
- Product usage cohorts
- Geographic cohorts

### 2. Retention Analysis

#### Retention Rate Calculation
```
Month N Retention = Customers Active in Month N / Customers Acquired in Month 0
```

#### Key Retention Metrics
- **Day 1, 7, 30 Retention**: Early engagement indicators
- **Monthly Retention**: Core business health metric
- **Annual Retention**: Long-term customer value

#### Retention Benchmarks by Industry
- **SaaS**: 90%+ monthly, 80%+ annual
- **E-commerce**: 20-30% monthly, varies widely
- **Mobile Apps**: 20% Day 1, 10% Day 7, 5% Day 30
- **Subscription**: 85%+ monthly

### 3. Revenue Cohort Analysis

#### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
```
NRR = (Starting ARR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Starting ARR
```

#### Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)
```
GRR = (Starting ARR - Churn - Contraction) / Starting ARR
```

#### Target Benchmarks
- **NRR**: >110% for best-in-class SaaS
- **GRR**: >90% for healthy SaaS business
