### 2. Risk Assessment Matrix

#### Probability Scale (1-5)
1. **Very Low** (0-10%): Highly unlikely to occur
2. **Low** (10-30%): Unlikely but possible
3. **Medium** (30-50%): Moderate probability
4. **High** (50-70%): Likely to occur
5. **Very High** (70-100%): Almost certain to occur

#### Impact Scale (1-5)
1. **Minimal** (0-5% impact): Minor effect on business
2. **Low** (5-15% impact): Noticeable but manageable
3. **Medium** (15-30% impact): Significant impact
4. **High** (30-50% impact): Major impact on viability
5. **Critical** (50%+ impact): Threatens business survival

#### Risk Score Calculation
```
Risk Score = Probability × Impact × Category Weight
Total Risk Score = Σ(Individual Risk Scores)
```

## 80/20 Risk Assessment Process

### Quick Risk Assessment (15 minutes)

#### Step 1: Top 5 Risk Identification (5 minutes)
Identify the five highest-impact risks across all categories:
- [ ] Risk 1: _________________ (Category: ________)

- [ ] Risk 3: _________________ (Category: ________)
- [ ] Risk 4: _________________ (Category: ________)
- [ ] Risk 5: _________________ (Category: ________)

#### Step 2: Probability and Impact Scoring (5 minutes)
For each identified risk:
- [ ] Assign probability score (1-5)
- [ ] Assign impact score (1-5)
- [ ] Calculate risk score (P × I)

#### Step 3: Mitigation Strategy Outline (5 minutes)
For each high-risk item (score >15):
- [ ] Identify primary mitigation approach
- [ ] Estimate mitigation cost/effort
- [ ] Define success metrics
