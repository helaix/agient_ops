# ROI and Valuation Framework for Early-Stage Businesses

## Overview

This framework provides systematic approaches to calculating return on investment (ROI) and valuing early-stage businesses. It synthesizes proven methodologies from venture capital, investment banking, and startup ecosystems to create practical evaluation tools.

## ROI Analysis Framework

### 1. ROI Calculation Methods

#### Simple ROI Formula
```
ROI = (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment × 100%
```

#### Time-Adjusted ROI (Annualized)
```
Annualized ROI = ((Final Value / Initial Value)^(1/Years)) - 1
```

#### Risk-Adjusted ROI
```
Risk-Adjusted ROI = (Expected Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Beta
```

### 2. Investment Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Angel Investment ($25K - $100K)
- **Target ROI**: 10-30x over 5-7 years
- **Annual Return**: 50-80%
- **Success Rate**: 10-20% of investments
- **Portfolio Approach**: 20-50 investments

#### Scenario 2: Seed Investment ($100K - $2M)
- **Target ROI**: 5-15x over 4-6 years
- **Annual Return**: 40-60%
- **Success Rate**: 15-25% of investments
- **Portfolio Approach**: 10-30 investments

#### Scenario 3: Series A Investment ($2M - $15M)
- **Target ROI**: 3-10x over 3-5 years
- **Annual Return**: 25-50%
- **Success Rate**: 20-35% of investments
- **Portfolio Approach**: 5-15 investments

### 3. ROI Benchmarking

- **NASDAQ**: ~12% annual return
- **Private Equity**: 15-25% annual return
- **Venture Capital**: 20-30% annual return (top quartile)

## Valuation Methodologies

### 1. Pre-Revenue Valuation Methods

#### Scorecard Method
**Factors and Weights:**
- Management Team (30%): 0.5x to 2.0x multiplier
- Market Opportunity (25%): 0.5x to 2.0x multiplier
- Product/Technology (15%): 0.5x to 1.5x multiplier
- Competitive Environment (10%): 0.5x to 1.5x multiplier
- Marketing/Sales (10%): 0.5x to 1.5x multiplier
- Need for Additional Investment (5%): 0.5x to 1.5x multiplier
- Other Factors (5%): 0.5x to 1.5x multiplier

**Calculation:**
```
Valuation = Base Valuation × Σ(Factor Weight × Factor Multiplier)
```

#### Risk Factor Summation Method
**Risk Categories (±$250K - $500K each):**
- [ ] Management risk
- [ ] Stage of business risk
- [ ] Legislation/political risk
- [ ] Manufacturing risk
- [ ] Sales and marketing risk
- [ ] Funding/capital raising risk
- [ ] Competition risk
- [ ] Technology risk
- [ ] Litigation risk
- [ ] International risk
- [ ] Reputation risk
- [ ] Potential lucrative exit

#### Berkus Method
**Value Components (up to $500K each):**
- Sound idea (basic value): $0-500K
- Prototype (reduces technology risk): $0-500K
- Quality management team: $0-500K
- Strategic relationships: $0-500K
- Product rollout or sales: $0-500K

**Maximum Pre-Money Valuation**: $2.5M

### 2. Revenue-Based Valuation Methods

#### Revenue Multiple Method
**Industry Multiples (Annual Revenue):**
- **SaaS**: 5-15x ARR
- **E-commerce**: 1-4x revenue
- **Marketplace**: 3-10x revenue
- **Hardware**: 1-3x revenue
- **Biotech**: 5-20x revenue (highly variable)

#### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
**Components:**
1. Project 5-10 year cash flows
2. Determine terminal value
3. Apply appropriate discount rate (15-30% for startups)
4. Calculate present value

**Formula:**
```
Valuation = Σ(Cash Flow_n / (1 + Discount Rate)^n) + Terminal Value / (1 + Discount Rate)^n
```

### 3. Market-Based Valuation

#### Comparable Company Analysis
**Process:**
1. Identify 5-10 comparable companies
2. Gather valuation multiples (Revenue, EBITDA, Users)
3. Apply median multiples to target company
4. Adjust for size, growth, and market differences

#### Precedent Transaction Analysis
**Data Sources:**
- PitchBook transaction database
- CB Insights funding rounds
- Crunchbase acquisition data
- Industry-specific databases

**Key Metrics:**
- Revenue multiples at exit
- EBITDA multiples at exit
- User/customer multiples
- Strategic premium analysis
