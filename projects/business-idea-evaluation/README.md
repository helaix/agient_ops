## Quick Start

### For Evaluators
1. **New Business Idea**: Use the template in `templates/business-idea-evaluation-template.md`
2. **Review Framework**: Read `framework/evaluation-framework.md` for methodology
3. **Apply Filters**: Use high-leverage filters from research findings
4. **Document Results**: Save completed evaluation in `evaluations/` directory

### For Researchers
1. **Review Coordination Plan**: See `research/research-coordination-plan.md`
2. **Choose Research Area**: Select from strategic-frameworks, market-timing, financial-evaluation, or execution-capability
3. **Follow Guidelines**: Use research methodology and quality criteria
4. **Document Findings**: Create comprehensive guides in respective research directories

### For Decision Makers
1. **Review Evaluations**: Check completed evaluations in `evaluations/` directory
2. **Understand Scoring**: Review scoring methodology in framework documentation
3. **Consider Integration**: See workflow integration guide for process context
4. **Make Decisions**: Use evaluation recommendations and supporting evidence

## Key Features

### High-Leverage Filters
- **80/20 Principle Analysis**: Focus on highest-impact factors
- **Star Principle Evaluation**: Market size, growth, competitive advantage
- **Model Advancement Impact**: AI/tech advancement threat vs. opportunity analysis
- **Strategic Timing Analysis**: Market readiness and competitive landscape timing

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- **Market Opportunity**: TAM/SAM/SOM sizing, customer validation, growth drivers
- **Competitive Landscape**: Direct/indirect competitors, advantages, risks
- **Technical Feasibility**: Technology requirements, complexity, scalability
- **Business Model Viability**: Revenue streams, unit economics, monetization
- **Resource Requirements**: Capital, human resources, infrastructure, partnerships
- **Risk Assessment**: Market, execution, competitive, and technology risks

### Quantitative Scoring
- **Weighted Scoring System**: 6 dimensions with appropriate weights
- **Threshold-Based Decisions**: Minimum score of 7.0/10 for proceed recommendation
- **Comparative Ranking**: Ability to rank multiple business ideas
- **Confidence Levels**: Assessment of evaluation confidence and certainty

## Integration Points

### With Existing Workflows
- **Research Coordination Workflow**: Multi-dimensional analysis phase
- **Task Decomposition Meta-Workflow**: Complex evaluation breakdown
- **Hierarchical Communication Workflow**: Team coordination and reporting
- **Structured Feedback Workflow**: Evaluation quality and recognition
- **Postmortem Workflow**: Continuous improvement and learning

### With Documentation Standards
- Consistent formatting and structure
- Integration with existing knowledge management
- Traceability and decision documentation
- Template-based standardization

## Research Areas

### Current Research Initiatives
1. **Strategic Business Frameworks** (HNTSMN-696): Porter's Five Forces, Blue Ocean Strategy, Jobs-to-be-Done, Lean Startup, Business Model Canvas
2. **Market and Timing Analysis** (HNTSMN-697): Technology adoption lifecycle, market sizing, timing frameworks, customer development
3. **Financial and Investment Evaluation** (HNTSMN-698): VC criteria, unit economics, ROI analysis, risk assessment, valuation frameworks
