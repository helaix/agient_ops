# AI-Driven NBA Playoff Betting System

## Project Overview

This system implements an AI-driven sports betting platform focused on NBA playoff basketball, designed to identify optimal bets that minimize risk and maximize returns with ROI as the primary performance metric.

## Key Objectives

- **Minimize Risk**: Identify value bets where bookmaker odds exceed actual probability
- **Maximize Returns**: Optimize ROI (net profit / total amount wagered * 100)
- **Focus on NBA Playoffs**: Account for unique dynamics of playoff basketball

## Implementation Components

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing Strategy** - Comprehensive data pipeline for NBA playoff data
2. **Feature Engineering and Model Development** - Advanced ML models for probability prediction
3. **Value Bet Identification System** - Core betting logic and risk assessment
4. **System Deployment and Integration** - Production deployment infrastructure
5. **Ethical, Legal, and Performance Evaluation Framework** - Compliance and monitoring

## Development Workflow

This project follows a hierarchical agent delegation pattern where:
- Parent agent coordinates overall implementation
- Child agents handle specialized components
- Integration occurs through standardized interfaces
- All work is consolidated into a single deliverable

## Getting Started

Each component directory contains its own README with specific implementation details and requirements.
