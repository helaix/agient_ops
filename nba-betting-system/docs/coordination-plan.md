# Agent Coordination Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the coordination strategy for implementing the AI-driven NBA playoff betting system using hierarchical agent delegation.

## Agent Delegation Structure

### Parent Agent (Orchestrator)
- **Role**: Overall project coordination and integration
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Create and maintain project scaffolding
  - Delegate tasks to child agents
  - Monitor progress and resolve dependencies
  - Integrate child agent outputs
  - Create final deliverable

### Child Agents (Specialists)

#### 1. Data Collection Agent
- **Sub-issue**: Data Collection and Preprocessing Strategy
- **Branch**: `feature/hlx-1299-data-collection-preprocessing`
- **Focus**: Data pipeline architecture and implementation

#### 2. Feature Engineering Agent  
- **Sub-issue**: Feature Engineering and Model Development
- **Branch**: `feature/hlx-1299-feature-engineering-models`
- **Focus**: ML model development and feature extraction

#### 3. Value Bet Agent
- **Sub-issue**: Value Bet Identification System
- **Branch**: `feature/hlx-1299-value-bet-identification`
- **Focus**: Betting algorithms and risk management

#### 4. Deployment Agent
- **Sub-issue**: System Deployment and Integration
- **Branch**: `feature/hlx-1299-system-deployment`
- **Focus**: Infrastructure and production deployment

#### 5. Evaluation Agent
- **Sub-issue**: Ethical, Legal, and Performance Evaluation Framework
- **Branch**: `feature/hlx-1299-ethical-legal-evaluation`
- **Focus**: Compliance and performance monitoring

## Communication Protocol

### Status Updates
- Child agents provide progress updates using standardized templates
- Regular check-ins at key milestones
- Immediate escalation of blockers

### Integration Process
1. Child agents complete work in their respective branches
2. Parent agent reviews and validates outputs
3. Integration occurs through branch merging
4. Final PR created by parent agent

### Dependencies
- Data Collection → Feature Engineering
- Feature Engineering → Value Bet Identification
- All components → Deployment
- All components → Evaluation

## Success Criteria
- All sub-issues completed with high-quality deliverables
- Successful integration of all components
- Comprehensive documentation and testing
- Production-ready system architecture
