# Feature Engineering and Model Development

## Overview
Advanced feature engineering and machine learning model development for NBA playoff outcome prediction.

## Components

### Feature Engineering
- Player performance metrics
- Team dynamics and chemistry
- Historical playoff performance
- Situational factors (home/away, rest days, etc.)
- Advanced analytics (PER, BPM, VORP, etc.)

### Model Development
- Probability prediction models
- Ensemble methods
- Deep learning approaches
- Model validation and testing
- Hyperparameter optimization

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Design feature extraction pipelines
- [ ] Implement advanced statistical features
- [ ] Develop ML model architectures
- [ ] Create model training workflows
- [ ] Build model evaluation frameworks

## Child Agent Instructions
Work from branch: `feature/hlx-1299-ai-driven-nba-playoff-betting-system-implementation-plan`
Create sub-branch: `feature/hlx-1299-feature-engineering-models`

Focus on creating sophisticated features that capture playoff-specific dynamics and building robust ML models for accurate probability prediction.
