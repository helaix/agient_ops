## Usage Examples

### Basic Feature Engineering
```python
from features import FeaturePipeline, FeatureConfig

# Configure feature engineering
config = FeatureConfig(
    lookback_games=10,
    playoff_weight_factor=1.5,
    home_court_advantage=0.55
)

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = FeaturePipeline(config)

# Extract features
features = pipeline.fit_transform(data)
```

### Model Training
```python
from features import TrainingPipeline

# Initialize training pipeline
trainer = TrainingPipeline()

# Run complete training workflow
report = trainer.run_full_pipeline(data, target_column='win')

# Make predictions
probabilities = trainer.predict(new_data)
```

### Model Evaluation
```python
from features import ModelEvaluator

evaluator = ModelEvaluator()

# Evaluate calibration
calibration_metrics = evaluator.evaluate_calibration(y_true, y_prob)

# Evaluate betting performance
betting_metrics = evaluator.evaluate_betting_performance(
    y_true, y_prob, odds, threshold=0.05
)
```

## Configuration

The system uses comprehensive configuration management:

```python
from features.config import config_manager

# Access configurations
feature_config = config_manager.feature_config
model_config = config_manager.model_config
evaluation_config = config_manager.evaluation_config
```

Key configuration options:
- **Feature Engineering**: Lookback windows, playoff weights, scaling methods
