| SSR & React Server Components | ✅ In Use | ✅ Potential | ✅ Potential | ❌ N/A |
| Server Functions | ✅ In Use | ✅ Potential | ✅ Potential | ❌ N/A |
| Cloudflare Workers | ✅ In Use | ✅ Perfect Match | ✅ Potential | ❌ N/A |
| D1 Database | ✅ In Use | ✅ Potential | ✅ Potential | ❌ N/A |
| Durable Objects | ✅ In Use | ✅ In Use | ✅ Potential | ❌ N/A |
| Real-time (WebSockets) | ✅ Available | ✅ Potential | ✅ Core Feature | ❌ N/A |
| Edge Computing | ✅ In Use | ✅ Perfect Match | ✅ Potential | ❌ N/A |

## Resource Requirements Comparison

### Development Resources

| Application | Team Size | Skill Requirements | Timeline | Effort Level |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Sparkflow** | Current team | RedwoodSDK maintenance | Ongoing | Low (maintenance) |
| **Cloudflare Demos** | 1 developer | RedwoodSDK + Cloudflare | 2-3 months | Medium |
| **Livestore** | 1-2 developers | Real-time systems + RedwoodSDK | 3-4 months | Medium-High |
| **DSTyS** | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not recommended |

### Budget Implications

- **Sparkflow**: Minimal ongoing costs for upgrades and maintenance
- **Cloudflare Demos**: Low cost, high educational value
- **Livestore**: Medium cost for web adapter development
- **DSTyS**: High cost with questionable ROI

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (High)

#### 1. Sparkflow - Optimization & Maintenance
- **Action**: Audit current RedwoodSDK usage for optimization opportunities
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for audit, ongoing optimization
- **Resources**: Current development team
- **Expected Outcome**: Improved performance, access to latest RedwoodSDK features

#### 2. Cloudflare Containers Demos - Migration & Showcase
- **Action**: Begin incremental migration starting with simple demos
- **Timeline**: 2-3 months for complete migration
- **Resources**: 1 developer with RedwoodSDK experience
- **Expected Outcome**: Comprehensive RedwoodSDK showcase, improved developer education

### Medium Priority (Medium)

#### 3. Livestore - Web Adapter Enhancement
- **Action**: Create optional RedwoodSDK web adapter
- **Timeline**: 3-4 months for initial implementation
- **Resources**: 1-2 developers with real-time systems expertise
- **Expected Outcome**: Enhanced web experience, Cloudflare edge performance

### Low Priority (Not Recommended)

#### 4. DSTyS - No Integration
- **Action**: Maintain current library architecture
- **Rationale**: Fundamental architectural mismatch
- **Alternative**: Use DSTyS as dependency in RedwoodSDK applications

## Success Metrics Framework

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Performance**: Response times, edge performance, sync latency
- **Development Velocity**: Feature delivery speed, deployment frequency
- **Quality**: Test coverage, bug rates, code maintainability
- **Adoption**: Developer usage, community engagement
