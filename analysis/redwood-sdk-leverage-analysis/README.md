# RedwoodSDK Leverage Analysis for Helaix Applications

## Overview

This analysis examines how RedwoodSDK patterns and examples can be leveraged across our application portfolio to improve performance, developer experience, and infrastructure efficiency.

## Research Structure

### 1. RedwoodSDK Pattern Analysis
- **Objective**: Deep dive into RedwoodSDK architectural patterns, features, and examples
- **Deliverable**: Comprehensive pattern documentation with implementation examples
- **Focus Areas**: SSR, React Server Components, Server Functions, Realtime features, Cloudflare integration

### 2. Application Portfolio Assessment
- **Objective**: Evaluate current applications for RedwoodSDK compatibility and benefit potential
- **Deliverable**: Application-specific analysis with migration/integration recommendations
- **Target Applications**: 
  - Sparkflow (TypeScript, 123 open issues)
  - DSTyS (TypeScript, 6 open issues)
  - Livestore (TypeScript, 2 open issues)
  - Cloudflare Containers Demos (existing Cloudflare integration)

### 3. Implementation Strategy Development
- **Objective**: Create actionable implementation roadmap with workplan impact assessment
- **Deliverable**: Phased implementation strategy with resource requirements and timeline
- **Considerations**: Migration complexity, infrastructure changes, team training needs

### 4. Workplan Impact Analysis
- **Objective**: Assess how RedwoodSDK adoption affects current development priorities and timelines
- **Deliverable**: Impact assessment with recommendations for workplan adjustments
- **Metrics**: Development velocity, resource allocation, timeline adjustments

## Research Coordination

- **Parent Issue**: HLX-1725
- **Research Branch**: `feature/hlx-1725-orchestrate-analysis-of-how-to-leverage-the-examples-in-this`
- **Documentation Standard**: Structured markdown with code examples and architectural diagrams
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Performance impact, development efficiency, infrastructure cost, implementation complexity

## Success Metrics
