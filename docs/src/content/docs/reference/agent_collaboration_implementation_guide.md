# Agent Collaboration Implementation Guide

This guide provides practical implementation steps for applying the Agent Collaboration Workflow in real-world scenarios. It includes concrete examples, code snippets, and best practices for effective multi-agent collaboration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before implementing the collaboration workflow, ensure:

1. All agents have access to the necessary repositories
2. Communication channels between agents are established
3. Agents understand their roles and responsibilities
4. The task has been properly analyzed and broken down

### Initial Setup

#### For Top-Level Agents

1. **Create the main feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/main-task-description
   ```

2. **Set up project scaffolding**:

   - Create necessary directory structures

   - Add placeholder files for components to be implemented

   - Document the overall architecture

3. **Push the initial branch**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project scaffolding"
   git push -u origin feature/main-task-description
   ```

4. **Create sub-issues for delegation**:

   - Use the Linear API to create sub-issues

   - Assign to appropriate Level 1 Agents

   - Include branch information in the issue description

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Creating and Assigning a Sub-Issue


```javascript
// Example code for creating a sub-issue using Linear API
const createSubIssue = async (parentIssueId, title, description, assigneeId) => {
  const issue = await linear.issueCreate({
    teamId: "TEAM_ID",
    title: title,
    description: description,
    parentId: parentIssueId,
    assigneeId: assigneeId
  });
  
  return issue;
};

// Usage
const subIssue = await createSubIssue(
  "PARENT_ISSUE_ID",
  "Implement Authentication Frontend",
  "# Task Assignment: Authentication Frontend\n\n## Context\nWe are building a new authentication system...\n\n## Technical Details\n- Branch to work from: `feature/main-task-description`\n- Create your branch with format: `level1/auth-frontend-components`\n\n...",
  "ASSIGNEE_ID"
);

```

### Example 2: Branch Management

#### For Level 1 Agents


```bash
# Clone the repository if not already done

git clone https://github.com/org/repo.git

# Checkout the parent branch

git checkout feature/main-task-description

# Create your branch

git checkout -b level1/auth-frontend-components

# Make your changes

# ...

# Commit and push

git add .
git commit -m "Implement basic authentication components"
git push -u origin level1/auth-frontend-components

```

#### For Level 2 Agents


```bash
# Checkout the parent branch

git checkout level1/auth-frontend-components

# Create your branch

git checkout -b level2/login-ui-implementation

# Make your changes

# ...

# Commit and push

git add .
git commit -m "Implement login form UI"
git push -u origin level2/login-ui-implementation

```

### Example 3: Merging Child Branches

#### For Level 1 Agents


```bash
# Checkout your branch

git checkout level1/auth-frontend-components

# Merge a Level 2 branch

git merge level2/login-ui-implementation

# Resolve any conflicts

# ...

# Commit and push

git add .
git commit -m "Merge login UI implementation"
git push origin level1/auth-frontend-components

```

#### For Top-Level Agents


```bash
# Checkout your branch

git checkout feature/main-task-description

# Merge a Level 1 branch

git merge level1/auth-frontend-components

# Resolve any conflicts

# ...

# Commit and push

git add .
git commit -m "Merge authentication frontend components"
git push origin feature/main-task-description

```

## Communication Examples

### Example 1: Status Update from Child to Parent


```

@parent-agent Status Update: Login UI Implementation

Progress: 70% complete
Current Status: Implementing form validation
Completed:

- Basic form layout

- Authentication API integration

- Error handling

In Progress:

- Form validation

- Accessibility improvements

Blockers: None

ETA: Will complete by EOD tomorrow

```

### Example 2: Task Assignment from Parent to Child


```

@child-agent Task Assignment: Implement OAuth Provider Integration

I've created a sub-issue for you to implement the OAuth provider integration component. This is part of our larger authentication system overhaul.

Branch to work from: `level1/auth-backend-services`
Create your branch as: `level2/oauth-provider-integration`

Key requirements:
1. Support Google, GitHub, and Microsoft OAuth providers
2. Implement token validation and refresh mechanisms
3. Create unified interface for all providers

Please refer to the detailed requirements in the sub-issue. Let me know if you have any questions.

Expected completion: 3 days

```

### Example 3: Reporting Completion


```

@parent-agent Task Completion: OAuth Provider Integration

I've completed the OAuth provider integration as requested. All requirements have been implemented and tested.

Key accomplishments:
1. Implemented support for all three providers
2. Created a unified interface with adapter pattern
3. Added comprehensive error handling
4. Wrote unit tests with 95% coverage

Branch: `level2/oauth-provider-integration`
Latest commit: 7a8b9c0

All changes have been pushed to my branch. Please review and let me know if any adjustments are needed.

```

## Handling Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Resolving Merge Conflicts

When merge conflicts occur:

1. **Identify the conflict source**:
   ```bash
   git merge level2/feature-branch
   # Conflict appears
   git status
   ```

2. **Resolve the conflict**:

   - Open the conflicting files

   - Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)

   - Edit the files to resolve conflicts

   - Ensure the resolution maintains functionality

3. **Complete the merge**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Merge level2/feature-branch and resolve conflicts"
   git push origin level1/parent-feature-branch
   ```

4. **Communicate the resolution**:
   ```
   @child-agent I've merged your changes and resolved conflicts in file.js. The conflict was related to the authentication function parameters. I maintained your implementation but adjusted the parameter order to match our API requirements.
   ```

### Scenario 2: Handling Blocked Tasks

When a sub-agent is blocked:

1. **sub-agent reports the blocker**:
   ```
   @parent-agent Blocker Alert: OAuth Integration

   I'm blocked on implementing the Microsoft OAuth integration due to missing API credentials. The documentation mentions we should have an Azure app registration, but I don't have access to these credentials.

   Impact: This blocks the Microsoft login functionality
   Workaround: I can continue with Google and GitHub integration while this is resolved
   ```

2. **Parent agent responds with a solution**:
   ```
   @child-agent Re: Blocker Alert

   Thanks for flagging this. I've added the Microsoft OAuth credentials to our secure environment variables. You can access them using:

   ```env
   MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=${process.env.MS_CLIENT_ID}
   MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=${process.env.MS_CLIENT_SECRET}
   ```

   Let me know if you need anything else to proceed.
   ```

### Scenario 3: Scope Changes

When requirements change:

1. **Top-level agent communicates the change**:
   ```
   @all-agents Scope Change: Authentication Requirements

   We need to make the following changes to our authentication implementation:

   1. Add support for Facebook OAuth (new requirement)
   2. Remove Microsoft OAuth (no longer needed)
   3. Enhance security with MFA support (increased priority)

   Impact assessment:

   - Level 1 Agent B: Update backend services to support these changes

   - Level 2 Agent B1: Pivot from Microsoft to Facebook OAuth integration

   - Level 2 Agent C2: Prioritize MFA implementation

   Please acknowledge this change and update your implementation plans accordingly.
   ```

2. **Agents acknowledge and adapt**:
   ```
   @parent-agent Re: Scope Change

   Acknowledged. I'll pivot from Microsoft to Facebook OAuth integration. This will require:

   1. Removing Microsoft OAuth code (already ~50% implemented)
   2. Adding Facebook OAuth SDK and integration
   3. Updating the provider interface to accommodate Facebook

   Impact on timeline: +1 day to original estimate
   New ETA: Friday EOD

   I'll start on this change immediately.
   ```

## Best Practices in Action

### 1. Effective Task Breakdown

**Example**: Breaking down a "User Management System" task


```

User Management System
├── Authentication (Level 1 Agent A)
│   ├── Login/Registration UI (Level 2 Agent A1)
│   ├── Auth API Integration (Level 2 Agent A2)
│   └── Social Auth Providers (Level 2 Agent A3)
├── User Profile (Level 1 Agent B)
│   ├── Profile UI Components (Level 2 Agent B1)
│   ├── Profile Data Management (Level 2 Agent B2)
│   └── Image Upload/Processing (Level 2 Agent B3)
└── Admin Controls (Level 1 Agent C)
    ├── User List/Search (Level 2 Agent C1)
    ├── User Editing Interface (Level 2 Agent C2)
    └── Permission Management (Level 2 Agent C3)

```

### 2. Clear Interface Definitions

Define clear interfaces between components to minimize integration issues:


```typescript
// Example interface definition for authentication service
interface AuthenticationService {
  // Methods that other components can rely on
  login(credentials: UserCredentials): Promise<AuthResult>;
  register(userData: UserRegistrationData): Promise<RegistrationResult>;
  validateToken(token: string): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  refreshToken(token: string): Promise<RefreshResult>;
  logout(userId: string): Promise<void>;
}

// This interface would be shared with all agents working on related components

```

### 3. Regular Synchronization

Schedule regular sync points:


```

Daily Updates: Each agent provides a brief status update
Mid-Point Review: After 50% of the timeline, conduct a comprehensive review
Integration Testing: Schedule specific points for integration testing
Final Review: Complete review before submitting the final PR

```

## Conclusion
