# Current Documentation Structure Audit

## Overview
This audit provides a baseline for the router tree optimization project.

## File Structure Analysis

### Reference Documentation (`docs/reference/`)
- `linear_workflows_reference.md` - Comprehensive Linear guide
- `communication_delegation_sops.md` - Communication standards
- `tactical_communication_standards.md` - Mission-critical communication
- `agent_communication_guidelines.md` - General communication guidance
- `linear_workflow_diagram.md` - Visual workflow guide
- `status_verification_checklist.md` - Status checking procedures

### Self-Improvement System (`docs/reference/self_improvement/`)
- Complex nested hierarchy with multiple subdirectories
- Error tracking, success patterns, feedback collection systems
- Research patterns and case studies
- Implementation guides and templates

### Workflow Patterns (`docs/src/content/docs/workflows/`)
- Pattern-specific documentation
- Meta-patterns and meta-meta-patterns
- Implementation examples and templates

## Optimization Opportunities

### High-Priority Router Candidates
1. **Linear Workflows Reference** - Large file, high traffic, router potential
2. **Self-Improvement System** - Deep hierarchy, consolidation opportunity
3. **Communication SOPs** - Multiple overlapping files

### Consolidation Targets
- Multiple communication-related files can be unified
- Self-improvement research can be streamlined
- Workflow patterns can use router-based organization

### Archive Candidates
- Outdated implementation examples
- Redundant case studies
- Superseded documentation versions

## Recommended Approach
1. Start with high-traffic files (Linear, Communication)
2. Apply router pattern to complex hierarchies (Self-Improvement)
3. Consolidate related content areas
4. Maintain essential detailed documentation as linked resources

## Success Criteria
- Maintain all essential information
- Reduce navigation complexity
- Improve discoverability
- Reduce maintenance overhead
