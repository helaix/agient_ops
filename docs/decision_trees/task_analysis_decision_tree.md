## Decision Criteria

### Task Clarity Assessment

The first decision point is determining whether the task description provides sufficient clarity:

| Criteria | Clear Description | Unclear Description |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Requirements | Specific, measurable requirements | Vague or ambiguous requirements |
| Deliverables | Clearly defined outputs or artifacts | Undefined or ambiguous deliverables |
| Constraints | Explicit constraints and limitations | Missing or unclear constraints |
| Context | Sufficient background information | Limited or missing context |
| Acceptance Criteria | Defined criteria for success | Unclear success metrics |

**Example Decision Process:**

For a task like "Implement user authentication":
1. Requirements: Unclear what authentication methods are required
2. Deliverables: Not specified which pages/components need authentication
3. Constraints: No mention of security requirements or standards
4. Decision: The task description is unclear, request clarification

### Scope Definition Assessment

Once clarity is established, assess whether the scope is well-defined:

| Criteria | Well-Defined Scope | Poorly Defined Scope |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Boundaries | Clear inclusion/exclusion criteria | Ambiguous boundaries |
| Size | Reasonable and estimable size | Unbounded or too large |
| Dependencies | Identified external dependencies | Unknown or unspecified dependencies |
| Timeline | Realistic timeline for completion | Missing or unrealistic timeline |
| Resources | Specified resources and tools | Unspecified resource requirements |

**Example Decision Process:**

For a task like "Improve website performance":
1. Boundaries: Unclear which aspects of performance to focus on
2. Size: No indication of how much improvement is expected
3. Dependencies: Unknown which systems affect performance
4. Decision: The scope is poorly defined, needs scope definition

### Technical Feasibility Assessment

Evaluate whether the requirements are technically feasible:

| Criteria | Feasible | Potentially Infeasible |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| Technical Constraints | Within known technical capabilities | Pushes beyond known capabilities |
| Resource Requirements | Resources available and sufficient | Requires unavailable resources |
| Timeline Constraints | Can be completed within timeline | Timeline too short for requirements |
| Dependencies | Dependencies can be managed | Critical dependencies outside control |
| Risk Level | Acceptable level of risk | High risk of failure |

**Example Decision Process:**

For a task like "Implement real-time collaboration":
1. Technical Constraints: Requires WebSocket expertise we may not have
2. Resource Requirements: May need additional infrastructure
3. Timeline: May be challenging within the given timeline
4. Decision: Potentially infeasible, needs technical feasibility analysis

### Task Complexity Assessment

Determine the complexity level of the task:

| Criteria | Simple | Moderate | Complex |
|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Scope | Narrow, well-contained | Multiple components but related | Broad, system-wide impact |
| Technical Difficulty | Straightforward implementation | Some challenging aspects | Multiple challenging aspects |
| Dependencies | Few or no dependencies | Several manageable dependencies | Many interdependent components |
| Risk | Low risk, isolated impact | Moderate risk, contained impact | High risk, broad impact |
| Estimated Time | Hours (1-4) | Days (1-3) | Days to weeks (3+) |

**Example Decision Process:**

For a task like "Add pagination to user list":
1. Scope: Focused on a single component
2. Technical Difficulty: Standard pagination implementation
3. Dependencies: Minimal, just the existing user list component
4. Risk: Low, isolated to one feature
5. Estimated Time: A few hours
6. Decision: Simple task, use direct execution planning

## Detailed Explanation of Decision Criteria

### Requesting Clarification

When a task description lacks clarity, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Specific Unclear Points**

   - List each ambiguous requirement or missing information

   - Prioritize blockers that prevent any progress

2. **Ask Focused Questions**

   - Frame questions to elicit specific, actionable responses

   - Provide options when possible to facilitate decision-making

   - Example: "The task mentions 'improve authentication'. Should this focus on (a) security enhancements, (b) user experience improvements, or (c) both?"

3. **Wait for Response**

   - Block further analysis until critical clarifications are received

   - For non-blocking clarifications, proceed with assumptions but document them clearly

### Scope Definition

When scope boundaries are unclear:

1. **Identify Boundaries**

   - Determine what is explicitly included and excluded

   - Identify ambiguous areas that need definition

2. **Propose Scope Definition**

   - Suggest clear boundaries based on context and priorities

   - Include rationale for proposed scope

   - Example: "Based on the performance issues mentioned, I propose focusing on (1) frontend rendering optimization and (2) API response time improvements, excluding database optimization which would require a separate effort."

3. **Seek Confirmation**

   - Request explicit approval of the proposed scope

   - Document the agreed scope for reference

### Technical Feasibility Analysis

When requirements may not be technically feasible:

1. **Identify Technical Constraints**

   - Pinpoint specific requirements that pose challenges

   - Assess available skills, tools, and infrastructure

2. **Research Alternatives**

   - Explore alternative approaches or technologies

   - Evaluate tradeoffs between different solutions

3. **Propose Modified Approach**

   - Suggest feasible alternatives that meet core requirements

   - Clearly explain tradeoffs and limitations

   - Example: "Full real-time collaboration may not be feasible within the timeline. I propose implementing a simpler version using periodic auto-save and conflict resolution, which achieves 80% of the functionality with significantly less complexity."

## Examples Illustrating the Decision Process

### Example 1: Documentation Enhancement Task

**Task:** "Enhance the API documentation with more examples"

**Analysis Process:**
1. **Clarity Assessment:**

   - Requirements: Somewhat clear, but "more examples" is non-specific

   - Deliverables: Not specified which API endpoints need examples

   - Decision: Request clarification on which endpoints to prioritize and how many examples are needed

2. **After Clarification:**

   - Scope is now defined: "Add 2-3 examples for each of the 5 core endpoints"

   - Technical feasibility: Completely feasible

   - Complexity: Simple to moderate

   - Decision: Use structured execution planning with clear steps for each endpoint

### Example 2: Complex Feature Implementation

**Task:** "Implement multi-factor authentication system"

**Analysis Process:**
1. **Clarity Assessment:**

   - Requirements: Clear need for MFA, but specific methods not specified

   - Deliverables: Integration points not fully defined

   - Decision: Request clarification on supported MFA methods and integration points

2. **After Clarification:**

   - Scope is defined: "Implement SMS and authenticator app MFA for web and mobile apps"

   - Technical feasibility: Feasible but challenging

   - Complexity: Complex (multiple components, security implications)

   - Decision: Use delegation planning to break down into sub-tasks:

     - Authentication backend enhancements

     - SMS integration service

     - Authenticator app integration

     - Web UI implementation

     - Mobile UI implementation

     - Security testing and validation

## Recommendations for Different Scenarios

### For Unclear Tasks

1. **When the task lacks context:**

   - Request background information and related documentation

   - Ask about the problem being solved, not just the requested solution

   - Example: "Could you provide context on why this feature is needed and how users will interact with it?"

2. **When requirements are ambiguous:**

   - Propose specific interpretations and ask for confirmation

   - Use examples to clarify understanding

   - Example: "I understand 'improve performance' to mean reducing page load time to under 2 seconds. Is this correct, or are there other performance aspects to address?"

### For Scope Definition

1. **When the scope is too broad:**

   - Propose breaking it into phases or separate tasks

   - Suggest prioritization criteria

   - Example: "This appears to be a large initiative. I suggest we focus on Phase 1 (user-facing features) first, followed by Phase 2 (admin features) in a separate task."

2. **When boundaries are unclear:**

   - Define explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria

   - Seek agreement on specific components affected

   - Example: "To clarify scope, this task will include updating the login, registration, and password reset flows, but exclude account management and user profile features. Is this understanding correct?"

### For Technical Feasibility

1. **When requirements exceed current capabilities:**

   - Propose a proof-of-concept or research spike

   - Suggest alternative approaches that achieve similar goals

   - Example: "Implementing this from scratch would be challenging. I recommend evaluating these three existing libraries that provide similar functionality."

2. **When timeline constraints are tight:**

   - Suggest a minimum viable implementation with future enhancements

   - Identify which requirements could be deferred

   - Example: "To meet the timeline, I recommend implementing the core functionality first, with these additional features planned for a follow-up task."
