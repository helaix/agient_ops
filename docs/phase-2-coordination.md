# Phase 2: Process Implementation Coordination

## Overview

This document coordinates the parallel execution of Phase 2 sub-issues for the Helaix Linear workspace organization initiative.

## Active Sub-Issues

### Phase 2.1: Project Consolidation Implementation
- **Issue**: [HLX-1846](https://linear.app/helaix/issue/HLX-1846)
- **Agent**: #23212
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Objective**: Reduce from 25 projects to 8 streamlined projects
- **Timeline**: 3-4 days

### Phase 2.2: Label Migration & Standardization  
- **Issue**: [HLX-1849](https://linear.app/helaix/issue/HLX-1849)
- **Agent**: #23215
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Objective**: Migrate from 18-label system to structured 6-category taxonomy
- **Timeline**: 2-3 days

### Phase 2.3: Workflow Optimization & Automation
- **Issue**: [HLX-1852](https://linear.app/helaix/issue/HLX-1852)
- **Agent**: Pending assignment
- **Status**: Ready for assignment
- **Objective**: Implement sustainable workflows and automation
- **Timeline**: 3-4 days

## Coordination Strategy

### Parallel Execution
- Phase 2.1 and 2.2 can run in parallel (minimal dependencies)
- Phase 2.3 depends on completion of 2.1 and 2.2 for full effectiveness
- All phases contribute to the overall workspace organization goal

### Integration Points
- Project consolidation results inform workflow automation rules
- Label standardization enables better automation triggers
- Both feed into comprehensive workflow optimization

### Success Metrics
- 68% project reduction (25 â†’ 8 projects)
- 100% label migration with new taxonomy
- Automated workflows operational
- Sustainable maintenance processes established

## Next Steps

1. Monitor child agent progress on Phase 2.1 and 2.2
2. Coordinate any dependencies or conflicts
3. Assign Phase 2.3 when prerequisites are met
4. Integrate all results into cohesive Phase 2 completion
5. Prepare for Phase 3: Long-term Maintenance

## Communication

- Regular updates via Linear comments
- Agent-to-agent coordination as needed
- Parent agent oversight and integration
- User updates on significant milestones
