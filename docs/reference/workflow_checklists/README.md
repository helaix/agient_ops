## Checklist Usage Guidelines

### How to Use These Checklists

1. **Select Appropriate Checklist**: Choose based on your task type and workflow pattern
2. **Customize as Needed**: Adapt checklist items to your specific context
3. **Track Progress**: Check off items as you complete them
4. **Document Deviations**: Note any items skipped and reasons why
5. **Review and Improve**: Suggest improvements based on experience
