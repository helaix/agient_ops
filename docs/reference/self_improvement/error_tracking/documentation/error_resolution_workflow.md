# Error Resolution Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the standardized workflow for resolving errors encountered by agents during their operations. Following this structured approach ensures that errors are addressed efficiently, effectively, and in a way that prevents recurrence.

## Resolution Workflow

The error resolution workflow consists of six key phases:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Detection  │────▶│   Triage    │────▶│  Analysis   │────▶│  Solution   │────▶│Implementation│────▶│ Verification │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                          │                                                                                │
                          │                                                                                │
                          │                   ┌─────────────┐                                             │
                          └──────────────────▶│ Escalation  │◀────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                              └─────────────┘
```

### Phase 1: Detection

**Objective**: Identify and document the error.

**Steps**:
1. Recognize that an error has occurred
2. Document the error using the [Error Report Template](../templates/error_report_template.md)
3. Capture all relevant details:
   - Error messages or symptoms
   - Context and environment
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Impact on task or system
4. Submit the error report to the tracking system

**Outputs**:
- Completed error report
- Initial error categorization

### Phase 2: Triage

**Objective**: Assess the error's priority and assign resources.

**Steps**:
1. Review the error report
2. Validate the error categorization
3. Determine severity and priority based on:
   - Impact on operations
   - Number of affected agents or users
   - Availability of workarounds
   - Frequency of occurrence
4. Assign the error to the appropriate agent or team
5. Set resolution timeframe based on priority

**Outputs**:
- Validated error categorization
- Priority assignment
- Resource allocation
- Resolution timeline

### Phase 3: Analysis

**Objective**: Understand the root cause and full impact of the error.

**Steps**:
1. Investigate the error using the [Error Analysis Template](../templates/error_analysis_template.md)
2. Reproduce the error if possible
3. Identify the root cause through:
   - Log analysis
   - Code review
   - Process examination
   - Environment inspection
4. Determine the full scope of impact
5. Identify related errors or issues
6. Document findings and update the error report

**Outputs**:
- Root cause identification
- Impact assessment
- Completed error analysis
- Updated error report

### Phase 4: Solution Design

**Objective**: Develop an effective solution to address the root cause.

**Steps**:
1. Brainstorm potential solutions
2. Evaluate solutions based on:
   - Effectiveness in addressing root cause
   - Implementation complexity
   - Potential side effects
   - Resource requirements
   - Long-term sustainability
3. Select the optimal solution
4. Document the solution using the [Solution Documentation Template](../templates/solution_documentation_template.md)
5. Create an implementation plan
6. Obtain necessary approvals

**Outputs**:
- Solution documentation
- Implementation plan
- Approval documentation

### Phase 5: Implementation

**Objective**: Apply the solution effectively.

**Steps**:
1. Implement the solution according to the plan
2. Document all changes made
3. Update relevant documentation
4. Communicate changes to affected agents or users
5. Provide training if necessary
6. Monitor for immediate issues

**Outputs**:
- Implemented solution
- Updated documentation
- Communication records
- Training materials (if applicable)

### Phase 6: Verification

**Objective**: Confirm that the error has been resolved.

**Steps**:
1. Test the solution in the environment where the error occurred
2. Verify that the error no longer occurs
3. Confirm that no new issues have been introduced
4. Obtain confirmation from the original reporter
5. Update the error report with verification results
6. Close the error report if resolved

**Outputs**:
- Verification results
- Updated error report
- Closure documentation (if resolved)

### Escalation Process

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Error cannot be resolved within the assigned timeframe
- Error is more complex than initially assessed
- Error requires resources or permissions beyond those available
- Implemented solution does not resolve the error

**Steps**:
1. Document the reason for escalation
2. Identify the appropriate escalation level
3. Transfer the error report with all accumulated information
4. Notify all relevant stakeholders
5. Continue monitoring until resolution

**Outputs**:
- Escalation documentation
- Stakeholder notifications

## Special Workflows

### Critical Errors

For errors categorized as "Critical":

1. Immediate notification to all affected parties
2. Formation of a dedicated resolution team
3. Expedited triage and analysis
4. Regular status updates (at least every 2 hours)
5. Post-resolution retrospective

### Recurring Errors

For errors that recur after resolution:

1. Re-open the original error report
2. Conduct a deeper analysis focusing on why the previous solution failed
3. Consider more fundamental changes to systems or processes
4. Implement enhanced monitoring
5. Conduct a thorough verification with extended testing

## Documentation Requirements

Throughout the resolution workflow, maintain comprehensive documentation:

1. **Error Report**: Initial documentation of the error
2. **Analysis Document**: Detailed investigation and root cause findings
3. **Solution Document**: Description of the solution and implementation plan
4. **Implementation Record**: Documentation of all changes made
5. **Verification Record**: Evidence that the error has been resolved
6. **Lessons Learned**: Insights gained that could prevent similar errors

## Metrics and Monitoring

Track the following metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the error resolution workflow:

1. **Time to Resolution**: Total time from detection to verification
2. **Phase Duration**: Time spent in each phase of the workflow
3. **First-Time Resolution Rate**: Percentage of errors resolved without recurrence
4. **Escalation Rate**: Percentage of errors requiring escalation
5. **Resolution Efficiency**: Resources expended relative to error severity
