# Error Tracking System

## Overview

The Error Tracking System is a framework for identifying, categorizing, analyzing, and resolving errors encountered by agents during their operations. It provides a structured approach to error management, enabling continuous improvement of agent performance.

## Key Components

1. **Error Categorization**: A taxonomy for classifying errors by type, severity, and impact.

2. **Error Reporting**: Templates and processes for documenting errors when they occur.

3. **Error Analysis**: Methodologies for identifying root causes and patterns.

4. **Resolution Tracking**: Processes for documenting and tracking error resolutions.

5. **Prevention Guidelines**: Strategies for preventing common errors.

## Implementation

For guidance on implementing the Error Tracking System, please refer to the [Integration Guide](../integration/README.md) and the [Implementation Workflow](../integration/implementation_workflow.md).
