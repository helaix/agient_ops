# Feedback Collection System

## Overview

The Feedback Collection System is a structured approach to collecting, analyzing, and implementing feedback on agent performance from various sources. It provides a framework for incorporating external perspectives into the continuous improvement of agent operations.

## Key Components

1. **Collection Methodologies**: Approaches for gathering different types of feedback.

2. **Feedback Templates**: Structured formats for collecting consistent feedback.

3. **Analysis Framework**: Methodologies for extracting insights from feedback.

4. **Prioritization Guidelines**: Criteria for determining which feedback to address first.

5. **Implementation Processes**: Workflows for turning feedback into actionable improvements.

## Implementation

For guidance on implementing the Feedback Collection System, please refer to the [Integration Guide](../integration/README.md) and the [Implementation Workflow](../integration/implementation_workflow.md).
