### Integration Principles
1. **Unified Data Flow**: All components share common data structures
2. **Cross-Component Learning**: Insights from one area inform others
3. **Consistent Processes**: Standardized workflows across all components
4. **Holistic Measurement**: Integrated metrics and reporting

## Component Integration Strategies

### Error Tracking ↔ Success Patterns
**Error-to-Success Conversion**:
- Document successful error resolution approaches as patterns
- Transform debugging techniques into reusable methodologies
- Convert prevention measures into proactive success strategies

**Success-Informed Error Prevention**:
- Use successful patterns to prevent common errors
- Apply proven approaches to error-prone situations
- Leverage success factors to strengthen weak processes

### Error Tracking ↔ Feedback Collection
**Feedback-Driven Error Resolution**:
- Collect stakeholder feedback on error impact and resolution
- Use feedback to prioritize error fixes
- Gather input on error communication effectiveness

**Error-Informed Feedback Requests**:
- Request specific feedback after error resolution
- Use error patterns to identify feedback collection opportunities
- Validate error prevention measures through stakeholder input

### Success Patterns ↔ Feedback Collection
**Feedback-Validated Success Patterns**:
- Use stakeholder feedback to confirm pattern effectiveness
- Gather input on pattern applicability and adaptation
- Collect suggestions for pattern improvements

**Pattern-Informed Feedback Collection**:
- Use successful feedback collection patterns
- Apply proven engagement strategies
- Leverage effective communication patterns for feedback requests

## Data Integration Framework

### Common Data Structures
```json
{
  "event_id": "unique_identifier",
  "timestamp": "ISO_8601_datetime",
  "event_type": "error|success|feedback",
  "context": {
    "task_type": "string",
    "stakeholders": ["list"],
    "environment": "string",
    "complexity": "low|medium|high"
  },
  "details": {
    "description": "string",
    "impact": "critical|high|medium|low",
    "resolution": "string",
    "lessons_learned": ["list"]
  },
  "relationships": {
    "related_events": ["event_ids"],
    "patterns": ["pattern_ids"],
    "feedback": ["feedback_ids"]
  }
