# Troubleshooting and Issue Resolution

## Overview

This directory provides comprehensive solutions for frequently encountered problems in Linear workflows, GitHub integration, agent communication, and performance optimization. Use this guide to quickly diagnose and resolve common issues.

## Quick Issue Resolution

### Emergency Protocols

1. **Critical System Failure**: Escalate immediately to parent agent or team lead
2. **Blocked by Dependencies**: Document blocker and notify relevant stakeholders
3. **Integration Failure**: Check system status and retry; escalate if persistent
4. **Data Loss Risk**: Stop work immediately and backup current state

## Linear Workflow Issues

### Issue Creation and Management

**Problem**: Cannot create new Linear issue
- **Cause**: Insufficient permissions or team configuration
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify team membership and permissions
  2. Check if team has issue creation enabled
  3. Contact team admin if permissions are missing

**Problem**: Issue not appearing in correct team
- **Cause**: Wrong team selected during creation
- **Solution**:
  1. Move issue to correct team using Linear interface
  2. Update team assignment in issue settings
  3. Verify team-specific workflows are applied

**Problem**: Cannot update issue status
- **Cause**: Workflow restrictions or permissions
- **Solution**:
  1. Check if status transition is allowed in team workflow
  2. Verify user permissions for status changes
  3. Review workflow configuration with team admin

### Linear-GitHub Integration Issues

**Problem**: PR not linking to Linear issue automatically
- **Cause**: Branch naming doesn't follow convention or integration not configured
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify branch name includes Linear issue ID (e.g., `feature/HLX-123-description`)
  2. Check Linear-GitHub integration settings
  3. Manually link PR in Linear issue attachments
  4. Add issue reference in PR description (`Fixes HLX-123`)

**Problem**: Linear status not updating when PR is merged
- **Cause**: Automation rules not configured or webhook failures
- **Solution**:
  1. Check team automation settings in Linear
  2. Verify GitHub webhook configuration
  3. Manually update Linear issue status
  4. Review webhook delivery logs in GitHub

**Problem**: Comments not syncing between Linear and GitHub
- **Cause**: Comment sync disabled or API rate limits
- **Solution**:
  1. Enable comment sync in Linear integration settings
  2. Check API rate limit status
  3. Verify webhook permissions and configuration
  4. Manually cross-post important comments

## GitHub Integration Problems

### Branch and PR Issues

**Problem**: Cannot create branch from Linear issue
- **Cause**: GitHub integration not configured or permissions missing
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify GitHub integration is enabled in Linear workspace
  2. Check repository permissions for Linear app
  3. Create branch manually using proper naming convention
  4. Link branch to issue manually

**Problem**: PR checks failing unexpectedly
- **Cause**: CI/CD configuration issues or dependency problems
- **Solution**:
  1. Review GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
  2. Check for dependency conflicts or version issues
  3. Verify environment variables and secrets
  4. Re-run checks after addressing identified issues

**Problem**: Merge conflicts in PR
- **Cause**: Concurrent changes to same files
- **Solution**:
  1. Fetch latest changes from target branch
  2. Resolve conflicts locally using git merge tools
  3. Test resolved changes thoroughly
  4. Push resolved changes to PR branch

### Repository Access Issues

**Problem**: Cannot access repository
- **Cause**: Permissions not granted or repository not found
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify repository exists and name is correct
  2. Check if Codegen app is installed on repository
  3. Request access from repository administrator
  4. Verify organization membership if applicable

**Problem**: Cannot push to branch
- **Cause**: Branch protection rules or permissions
- **Solution**:
  1. Check branch protection settings
  2. Verify push permissions for user/app
  3. Create PR instead of direct push if required
  4. Request admin override if necessary

## Agent Communication Failures

### Inter-Agent Communication

**Problem**: Child agent not responding to parent
- **Cause**: Agent overload, system issues, or communication channel problems
- **Solution**:
  1. Check agent status and availability
  2. Retry communication with different method
  3. Escalate to system administrator if persistent
  4. Implement fallback communication plan

**Problem**: Status updates not reaching stakeholders
- **Cause**: Communication channel configuration or notification settings
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify notification settings for all stakeholders
  2. Check communication channel configuration
  3. Send manual updates as backup
  4. Review and update stakeholder contact information

**Problem**: Conflicting instructions from multiple agents
- **Cause**: Coordination failure or unclear hierarchy
- **Solution**:
  1. Escalate to parent agent for clarification
  2. Document conflicting instructions
  3. Establish clear priority and authority
  4. Implement coordination protocol to prevent recurrence

### Task Coordination Issues

**Problem**: Duplicate work being performed
- **Cause**: Poor task coordination or communication gaps
- **Solution**:
  1. Immediately halt duplicate work
  2. Coordinate with other agents to divide tasks
  3. Update task assignments and documentation
  4. Implement better coordination protocols

**Problem**: Dependencies not being communicated
- **Cause**: Unclear dependency mapping or communication failures
- **Solution**:
  1. Document all task dependencies clearly
  2. Establish regular dependency check-ins
  3. Create dependency tracking system
  4. Notify all affected parties of dependency changes

## Performance and Optimization Issues

### System Performance

**Problem**: Slow response times from Linear or GitHub
- **Cause**: API rate limits, system load, or network issues
- **Solution**:
  1. Check API rate limit status
  2. Implement request throttling if needed
  3. Retry requests with exponential backoff
  4. Contact support if system-wide issues persist

**Problem**: Large repositories causing timeouts
- **Cause**: Repository size or complexity exceeding limits
- **Solution**:
  1. Use shallow clones when possible
  2. Implement pagination for large data sets
  3. Break down operations into smaller chunks
  4. Consider repository optimization strategies

### Workflow Efficiency

**Problem**: Workflows taking longer than expected
- **Cause**: Inefficient processes or resource constraints
- **Solution**:
  1. Analyze workflow bottlenecks
  2. Optimize or parallelize time-consuming steps
  3. Allocate additional resources if needed
  4. Implement workflow improvements

**Problem**: High error rates in automated processes
- **Cause**: Configuration issues or environmental problems
- **Solution**:
  1. Review error logs for patterns
  2. Validate configuration settings
  3. Test in isolated environment
  4. Implement better error handling and recovery

## Escalation Procedures

### When to Escalate

- System-wide failures affecting multiple users
- Security-related issues or data breaches
- Issues that cannot be resolved within 2 hours
- Problems requiring administrative access or permissions
- Conflicts between team members or agents

### How to Escalate

1. **Document the Issue**: Provide clear description, steps to reproduce, and impact
2. **Gather Context**: Include relevant logs, screenshots, and error messages
3. **Identify Stakeholders**: Determine who needs to be notified
4. **Choose Escalation Path**: Select appropriate escalation channel
5. **Follow Up**: Monitor resolution progress and provide updates

### Escalation Contacts

- **Technical Issues**: System Administrator or DevOps Team
- **Process Issues**: Team Lead or Project Manager
- **Integration Issues**: Platform Administrator
- **Security Issues**: Security Team (immediate escalation)

### Proactive Monitoring

- Implement health checks for critical integrations
- Set up alerts for common failure scenarios
- Regular review of error logs and patterns
- Periodic testing of backup and recovery procedures

### Documentation and Training

- Keep troubleshooting guides updated
- Provide training on common issues and solutions
- Create runbooks for complex procedures
- Share lessons learned from resolved issues

### Process Improvement

- Regular review of incident patterns
