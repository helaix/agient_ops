### Timeliness and Responsiveness
- **Acknowledge Quickly**: Respond to communications within 2 hours when possible
- **Set Expectations**: Communicate realistic timelines for responses
- **Provide Updates**: Share progress regularly, especially for long-running tasks
- **Escalate Appropriately**: Flag urgent issues immediately

### Professional Standards
- **Maintain Consistency**: Use standardized formats and terminology
- **Be Constructive**: Focus on solutions rather than just problems

- **Stay Focused**: Keep communications relevant to the task at hand

## Inter-Agent Communication Protocols

### Parent-Child Agent Communication

**Parent to Child Instructions**:
```markdown
**Task Assignment**: [Clear task description]
**Context**: [Background and reasoning]
**Deliverables**: [Specific outputs expected]
**Timeline**: [Deadline and milestones]
**Resources**: [Available tools and information]
**Success Criteria**: [How completion will be measured]
**Questions**: [Encourage clarification requests]
```

**Child to Parent Updates**:
```markdown
**Progress Update**: [Task identifier]
**Status**: [Current state of work]
**Completed**: [What has been finished]
**In Progress**: [Current activities]
**Next Steps**: [Planned actions]
**Blockers**: [Any impediments]
**Questions**: [Need for clarification or help]
**ETA**: [Estimated completion time]
```

### Peer Agent Communication

**Information Sharing**:
```markdown
**Information Share**: [Topic/Subject]
**Context**: [Why this information is relevant]
**Details**: [Specific information to share]
**Impact**: [How this affects ongoing work]
**Action Required**: [What recipient should do with this information]
```

**Collaboration Requests**:
```markdown
**Collaboration Request**: [Purpose]
**Background**: [Context and reasoning]
**Scope**: [What collaboration involves]
**Timeline**: [When collaboration is needed]
**Your Role**: [What you're asking the other agent to do]
**My Role**: [What you will contribute]
**Expected Outcome**: [What success looks like]
```

### Cross-Team Communication

**Status Sharing**:
- Share relevant progress with affected teams
- Highlight dependencies and blockers
- Communicate timeline changes promptly
- Provide context for decisions made

**Resource Coordination**:
- Request resources with clear justification
- Share resources when appropriate
- Coordinate to avoid conflicts
- Communicate resource constraints

## Communication Channels and Methods

### Synchronous Communication
**When to Use**:
- Urgent issues requiring immediate attention
- Complex discussions needing real-time interaction
- Decision-making sessions with multiple stakeholders
- Brainstorming and collaborative problem-solving

**Best Practices**:
- Prepare agenda and objectives in advance
- Share relevant materials beforehand
- Keep discussions focused and time-boxed
- Document decisions and action items
- Follow up with written summaries

### Asynchronous Communication
**When to Use**:
- Status updates and progress reports
- Information sharing and documentation
- Non-urgent questions and requests
- Detailed explanations and analysis

**Best Practices**:
- Use clear, descriptive subject lines
- Structure information logically
- Include all necessary context
- Specify required actions and timelines
- Use appropriate formatting for readability

### Documentation Communication
**When to Use**:
- Permanent record of decisions and processes
- Knowledge sharing across teams and time
- Complex procedures and guidelines
- Reference materials and standards

**Best Practices**:
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Include examples and use cases
- Keep information current and accurate
- Make documents easily discoverable
- Version control important documents

## Communication Quality Standards

### Message Structure
1. **Purpose Statement**: Clear reason for communication
2. **Context**: Background information needed
3. **Main Content**: Core information or request
4. **Action Items**: What needs to be done
5. **Timeline**: When actions are needed
6. **Follow-up**: How and when to respond

### Language Standards
- **Professional Tone**: Respectful and business-appropriate
- **Clear Language**: Avoid jargon and ambiguous terms
- **Concise Expression**: Communicate efficiently without losing clarity
- **Positive Framing**: Focus on solutions and opportunities

### Information Quality
- **Accuracy**: Verify facts before sharing
- **Completeness**: Include all necessary information
- **Relevance**: Focus on information that matters to the recipient
- **Timeliness**: Share information when it's most useful

## Conflict Resolution and Escalation

### Conflict Prevention
- **Clear Expectations**: Set explicit goals and responsibilities
- **Regular Check-ins**: Maintain ongoing communication
- **Early Warning**: Flag potential issues before they become problems
- **Collaborative Approach**: Work together to find solutions

### Conflict Resolution Process
1. **Direct Communication**: Address issues directly with involved parties
2. **Seek Understanding**: Listen to all perspectives
3. **Find Common Ground**: Identify shared goals and interests
4. **Develop Solutions**: Collaborate on mutually acceptable approaches
5. **Document Agreements**: Record decisions and commitments
6. **Monitor Progress**: Follow up to ensure resolution

### Escalation Procedures
**When to Escalate**:
- Direct communication fails to resolve issues
- Conflicts impact project timelines or quality
- Resource conflicts cannot be resolved locally
- Technical decisions require higher-level input

**How to Escalate**:
1. **Document the Issue**: Clearly describe the problem and attempts at resolution
2. **Identify Stakeholders**: Determine who needs to be involved
3. **Propose Solutions**: Suggest potential approaches
4. **Request Specific Action**: Be clear about what you need
5. **Set Timeline**: Indicate urgency and deadlines

## Communication Metrics and Improvement

- **Clarity Score**: How well messages are understood
- **Action Completion**: How often requested actions are completed
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Feedback on communication quality

### Continuous Improvement
- **Regular Feedback**: Gather input on communication effectiveness
- **Process Refinement**: Update procedures based on lessons learned
