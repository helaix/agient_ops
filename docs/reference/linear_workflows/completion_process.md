- Verify all links work correctly
- Check for outdated information
- Ensure examples are current

### 3. Stakeholder Communication
```markdown
**Issue Complete**: https://linear.app/helaix/issue/HLX-1234

**Summary**: [Brief description of what was accomplished]

**Changes Made**:
- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2]
- [Key change 3]

**Testing**: [Description of testing performed]

**Next Steps**: [Any follow-up actions needed]
```

### 4. State Transition
1. **Update Issue Status**: Move to "Done" state
2. **Link Pull Request**: Attach PR to Linear issue
3. **Tag Stakeholders**: Notify relevant team members
4. **Close Related Issues**: Update dependent issues

## Review Process Guidelines

### Code Review Standards
- **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
- **Readability**: Is the code clear and well-documented?
- **Performance**: Are there any performance concerns?
- **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- **Maintainability**: Will this be easy to maintain and extend?

### Review Feedback Format
```markdown
**Overall Assessment**: [Approve/Request Changes/Comment]

**Strengths**:
- [What was done well]
- [Good practices observed]

**Suggestions**:
- [Specific improvements]
- [Alternative approaches]

**Required Changes**:
- [Must-fix issues]
- [Security concerns]
```

### Addressing Review Feedback
1. **Acknowledge Quickly**: Respond to reviews within 24 hours
2. **Ask for Clarification**: If feedback is unclear, ask questions
3. **Make Changes Promptly**: Address feedback in a timely manner
4. **Explain Decisions**: Document why certain approaches were chosen
5. **Request Re-review**: Ask for another review after changes

## Post-Completion Activities

### Knowledge Sharing
- Document lessons learned
- Share successful patterns with team
- Update process documentation
- Conduct retrospectives for complex issues

### Metrics Collection
- Track completion time vs. estimates
- Monitor defect rates
- Measure stakeholder satisfaction
- Analyze process effectiveness

### Follow-up Actions
- Monitor production deployment
- Address any post-deployment issues
- Gather user feedback
- Plan future improvements

## Quality Gates

### Definition of Done
An issue is only complete when:
1. All acceptance criteria met
2. Code reviewed and approved
3. Tests written and passing
4. Documentation updated
5. Stakeholders notified
6. Production deployment successful

### Rollback Procedures
If issues are discovered post-completion:
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Determine severity and impact
2. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders immediately
3. **Rollback Decision**: Decide whether to rollback or fix forward
4. **Execute Plan**: Implement chosen approach quickly
5. **Post-Mortem**: Analyze what went wrong and improve process

## Success Metrics

### Completion Quality
- **First-time Success Rate**: Issues completed without rework
- **Defect Escape Rate**: Issues found after completion
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Feedback from issue requesters
- **Timeline Accuracy**: Actual vs. estimated completion time

### Process Efficiency
- **Review Cycle Time**: Time from PR creation to approval
- **Feedback Response Time**: How quickly feedback is addressed
- **Deployment Success Rate**: Percentage of successful deployments
- **Knowledge Transfer Effectiveness**: How well learnings are shared
