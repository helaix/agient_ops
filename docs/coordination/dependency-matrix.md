# Dependency Matrix

This document tracks dependencies between different documentation areas in the workflow documentation improvement project.

## Overview

The dependency matrix helps identify and manage interdependencies between the seven documentation areas. This ensures that work is properly sequenced and coordinated.

## Matrix Legend

- **Provides**: The row area provides this capability to the column area
- **Requires**: The row area requires this capability from the column area
- **Collaborates**: The row and column areas need to collaborate on this capability
- **Independent**: No significant dependency exists

## Dependency Matrix

| Area | Discoverability & Navigation | Practical Implementation | Learning & Onboarding | Measurement & Improvement | Integration & Extensibility | Community & Collaboration | Contextual Adaptation |
|------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Discoverability & Navigation** | - | Provides: Navigation for implementation tools | Provides: Navigation for learning paths | Collaborates: Navigation analytics | Provides: Cross-system navigation | Provides: Community content navigation | Collaborates: Persona-based navigation |
| **Practical Implementation** | Requires: Tool discoverability | - | Provides: Implementation examples for learning | Requires: Implementation metrics | Collaborates: API implementation | Provides: Community implementation examples | Requires: Role-specific implementation guides |
| **Learning & Onboarding** | Requires: Learning path navigation | Requires: Implementation examples | - | Collaborates: Learning effectiveness metrics | Requires: Integration tutorials | Collaborates: Community learning | Requires: Skill-level adaptation |
| **Measurement & Improvement** | Requires: Navigation analytics | Requires: Implementation metrics | Requires: Learning metrics | - | Requires: Integration metrics | Requires: Community feedback | Requires: Contextual usage data |
| **Integration & Extensibility** | Requires: Cross-system navigation | Collaborates: API implementation | Provides: Integration learning resources | Provides: Integration metrics | - | Collaborates: Community extensions | Requires: System-specific variants |
| **Community & Collaboration** | Requires: Community content navigation | Requires: Community implementation examples | Collaborates: Community learning | Provides: Community feedback | Collaborates: Community extensions | - | Requires: Community context adaptation |
| **Contextual Adaptation** | Collaborates: Persona-based navigation | Provides: Role-specific guides | Provides: Skill-level adaptation | Provides: Contextual usage data | Provides: System-specific variants | Provides: Community context adaptation | - |

## Critical Dependencies

These dependencies are considered critical to the project timeline:

1. **Navigation Framework** (Week 3)
   - Provider: Discoverability & Navigation
   - Consumers: All other areas
   - Impact: Required for all areas to implement their documentation structure

2. **Documentation Templates** (Week 3)
   - Provider: Shared Resources
   - Consumers: All areas
   - Impact: Required for consistent documentation development

3. **Measurement Framework** (Week 4)
   - Provider: Measurement & Improvement
   - Consumers: All areas
   - Impact: Required for quality assessment and improvement

4. **User Personas** (Week 2)
   - Provider: Contextual Adaptation
   - Consumers: All areas
   - Impact: Required for targeted documentation development

5. **Integration Standards** (Week 5)
   - Provider: Integration & Extensibility
   - Consumers: All areas
   - Impact: Required for system integration and extensibility

## Dependency Management Process

1. **Identification**: New dependencies should be added to this matrix as they are identified
2. **Assessment**: The Main Coordinator Agent assesses the impact of each dependency
3. **Prioritization**: Critical dependencies are prioritized in the project timeline
4. **Tracking**: Progress on dependencies is tracked in weekly status reports
5. **Resolution**: Blockers related to dependencies are escalated to the Main Coordinator Agent
