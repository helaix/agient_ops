- Ensure all documentation is properly linked and accessible
- Maintain consistency across all integrated materials

- 7 additional agents will be spawned as sub-issues are picked up

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis and Conflict Resolution
Each PR will be analyzed for:
- Merge conflicts with main branch
- Content overlap with existing documentation
- Integration points with the main rule entry system

### Phase 2: Content Integration
- Update main rule entry point to reference new documentation
- Ensure proper linking and navigation
- Maintain consistency in documentation structure

### Phase 3: Validation
- Verify all links work correctly
- Ensure documentation is accessible and discoverable
- Test integration with existing workflows

## Main Rule Entry Point Integration
The primary integration target is `.cursor/rules/__START_HERE.mdc` which serves as the main entry point for agent operations guidelines.

## Coordination Branch
Working branch: `feature/hlx-1726-pr-integration-coordination`

## Sub-Agent Tasks
Each PR will be assigned to a dedicated sub-agent for:
1. Conflict resolution
2. Content review and integration
3. Testing and validation
4. Documentation updates

## Success Criteria
- All 11 PRs successfully merged
- No merge conflicts remaining
- All documentation properly linked in main entry point
- Consistent documentation structure maintained
- All workflows and guidelines accessible through main entry point
