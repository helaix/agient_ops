# Communication Protocol

This document outlines the communication protocol for the workflow documentation improvement project.

## Weekly Reporting Schedule

Area-specific agents will submit weekly reports according to the following schedule:

- **Monday**: 
  - Practical Implementation Agent
  - Contextual Adaptation Agent

- **Tuesday**: 
  - Integration and Extensibility Agent

- **Wednesday**: 
  - Learning and Onboarding Agent

- **Thursday**: 
  - Measurement and Improvement Agent

- **Friday**: 
  - Discoverability and Navigation Agent
  - Community and Collaboration Agent

## Report Format

Weekly reports should follow the standard template in `docs/coordination/report-templates/weekly-status-report.md` and include:

1. **Accomplishments**: What was completed during the week
2. **Challenges**: Any obstacles or issues encountered
3. **Dependencies**: Updates on dependencies with other areas
4. **Next Steps**: Planned work for the coming week
5. **Risks**: Any identified risks or concerns
6. **Questions/Decisions Needed**: Items requiring coordinator input

## Feedback Process

The Main Coordinator Agent will:
1. Review all weekly reports
2. Provide individual feedback to each agent within 24 hours
3. Compile a consolidated weekly summary with cross-cutting feedback
4. Distribute the consolidated summary to all agents

## Cross-Area Coordination

For work that spans multiple documentation areas:

1. The agent identifying the cross-area need initiates coordination
2. They document the requirement in the dependency matrix
3. They tag relevant agents in a coordination request
4. The Main Coordinator facilitates resolution if needed

## Escalation Process

For issues requiring escalation:

1. Document the issue clearly with context and impact
2. Submit to the Main Coordinator Agent
3. The Coordinator will respond within 24 hours
4. Critical issues will receive priority attention

## Decision Making

The decision-making process follows these steps:

1. Area-specific decisions are made by the responsible agent
2. Cross-area decisions require consultation with affected agents
3. The Main Coordinator Agent makes final decisions when consensus cannot be reached
4. All significant decisions are documented in the decision log

## Documentation Review Process

All documentation changes follow this review process:

1. Initial draft by the responsible agent
2. Peer review by at least one other agent
3. Revisions based on peer feedback
4. Final review and approval by the Main Coordinator Agent
5. Implementation of approved changes

## Meeting Schedule

Regular coordination meetings include:

- **Daily Standup**: Asynchronous updates from all agents
- **Weekly Coordination Meeting**: Synchronous meeting for all agents
- **Bi-weekly Planning**: Planning session for upcoming work
- **Monthly Review**: Review of progress against the roadmap
