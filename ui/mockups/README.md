# Multi-Agent Management UI/UX Mockups

This directory contains the HTML/CSS/JS implementations of the UI/UX mockups for the Multi-Agent Management system across desktop, tablet, and mobile form factors.

## Overview

The Multi-Agent Management system provides a comprehensive interface for monitoring, controlling, and orchestrating multiple AI agents. The UI is designed to be responsive and adaptable across different device form factors.

## Directory Structure

- `/desktop` - Desktop form factor implementations
  - `agent-detail-view.html` - Detailed view for a specific agent
  - `agent-detail-view.js` - JavaScript for the agent detail view
  - `styles.css` - Shared styles for desktop views

- `/tablet` - Tablet form factor implementations (to be implemented)

- `/mobile` - Mobile form factor implementations (to be implemented)

- `index.html` - Unified showcase page for viewing all mockups
- `showcase.css` - Styles for the showcase page
- `showcase.js` - JavaScript for the showcase page

## Currently Implemented Views

- **Desktop Agent Detail View**: Provides detailed information and controls when focusing on a specific agent. Includes agent profile, task queue, context access, performance metrics, and command terminal sections.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the unified showcase page
2. Use the dropdown selector to switch between different views
3. Use the navigation buttons to move between views
4. Click the fullscreen button to view the current mockup in fullscreen mode

## Integration Points

The mockups are designed to be integrated into a unified system. Key integration points include:

- **Navigation**: Each view includes navigation elements to move between different views
- **Data Sharing**: Views are designed to share agent data and context information
- **Consistent Design**: All views follow a consistent design language and interaction patterns

## Dependencies

- Chart.js (via CDN)

## Browser Compatibility

These mockups are designed to work in modern browsers including:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Notes for Developers

- These are static mockups intended for demonstration purposes
- In a production implementation, these would be connected to backend services
- The mockups use sample data that would be replaced with real data in production
