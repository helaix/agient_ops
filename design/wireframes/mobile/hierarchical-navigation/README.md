# Mobile Hierarchical Navigation

This directory contains the implementation of the Mobile Hierarchical Navigation for the Multi-Agent Management system. The navigation pattern is optimized for small screens to provide intuitive movement through complex information hierarchies.

## Navigation Patterns

### 1. List → Detail Pattern
- Navigate from lists to detailed views
- Smooth transitions between levels
- Back navigation
- List item previews
- Search and filter capabilities

### 2. Breadcrumb Navigation
- Track location in complex workflows
- Tap to navigate to previous levels
- Compact yet informative display
- Contextual information

### 3. Modal Overlays
- Focused interfaces for specific actions
- Non-disruptive information display
- Dismissible with gestures
- Contextual controls

### 4. Pull-to-Refresh
- Update agent status and information
- Visual feedback during refresh
- Last updated timestamp
- Customizable refresh behavior

- HTML/CSS/JS with mobile-specific optimizations
- Responsive behavior for various mobile screen sizes
