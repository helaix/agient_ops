# Cross-Device Features

This document outlines the features and design patterns that are consistent across all form factors (desktop, tablet, and mobile) in the Multi-Agent Management system.

## 1. Unified Command Language

A consistent command syntax works across all devices:

```
@[agent] [action] [parameters]
```

Examples:

* `@research find information about renewable energy`
* `@all pause tasks`
* `@assistant schedule meeting with marketing team`

## 2. Context Visualization

Visual representation of context sharing between agents:

* **Desktop**: Interactive network graph with detailed relationships
* **Tablet**: Simplified network with expandable details
* **Mobile**: List view with relationship indicators

## 3. Priority Management

Visual system for managing priorities:

* **Color Coding**: Red (urgent), Orange (high), Yellow (medium), Green (low)
* **Size Variation**: Higher priority items appear larger in spatial views
* **Position**: Higher priority items appear at the top in list views

## 4. Notification System

Adaptive notifications across devices:

* **Desktop**: Non-intrusive sidebar notifications with action buttons
* **Tablet**: Banner notifications with quick actions
* **Mobile**: Standard system notifications with deep links

## 5. Synchronization

Seamless transition between devices:

* **State Preservation**: Continue work from where you left off on another device
* **Responsive Layouts**: UI adapts automatically to screen size changes
* **Offline Support**: Core functionality works offline with synchronization when reconnected

## Special Considerations

### 1. Accessibility

* **Screen Reader Support**: All interfaces work with screen readers
* **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visibility option
* **Voice Control**: Complete functionality through voice commands
* **Adjustable Text Size**: Interface scales with system text size settings

### 2. Performance Optimization

* **Progressive Loading**: Load essential information first
* **Bandwidth Awareness**: Adapt data usage based on connection quality
* **Battery Efficiency**: Reduce update frequency on mobile when on battery

### 3. Security & Privacy

* **Authentication Options**: Biometric, PIN, or password
* **Permission Controls**: Granular control over agent capabilities
* **Activity Logs**: Transparent record of all agent actions
* **Privacy Mode**: Limit sensitive information display on public screens
