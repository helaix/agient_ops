# Multi-Agent Management UI/UX Design

This directory contains design assets, wireframes, and specifications for the Multi-Agent Management system across desktop, tablet, and mobile form factors.

## Directory Structure

- `/wireframes` - Contains wireframe mockups for each form factor
  - `/desktop` - Desktop experience wireframes (Laptop/Large Screens)
  - `/tablet` - Tablet experience wireframes (iPad/Medium Screens)
  - `/mobile` - Mobile experience wireframes (Phone/Small Screens)
- `/assets` - Shared design assets, icons, and resources

## Design System

The Multi-Agent Management UI/UX follows these key principles:

1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Essential information is always visible, with details available through intuitive expansion
2. **Contextual Adaptation** - The UI transforms based on device capabilities while maintaining functional consistency
3. **Spatial Organization** - Agents and tasks are visually organized to reflect relationships and priorities

## Color Coding for Priority Management

- **Red** - Urgent priority
- **Orange** - High priority
- **Yellow** - Medium priority
- **Green** - Low priority
