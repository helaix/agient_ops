# Autonomous AI Innovation Monitoring & Adaptation System

## Overview

This system provides autonomous monitoring of AI innovations and automatic adaptation of existing systems to maintain competitive advantage and resilience against technological disruption.

## Architecture

The system follows a multi-layered architecture implementing three key workflow patterns from the Agent Operations Guidelines:

### Core Components

1. **Research Coordination Layer** (`research/`)
   - AI landscape analysis and trend identification
   - Multi-source intelligence gathering
   - Structured research synthesis

2. **Monitoring Framework** (`monitoring/`)
   - Real-time AI innovation tracking
   - Threat detection and early warning
   - Impact assessment automation

3. **Adaptation Engine** (`adaptation/`)
   - Autonomous system adaptation
   - Contingency plan execution
   - Risk mitigation strategies

4. **Core Orchestration** (`core/`)
   - Workflow coordination
   - Decision engine
   - System state management

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Operation**: Minimal manual intervention required
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Anticipates trends before they become threats
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Automatically adjusts systems based on detected changes
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles evolving AI landscape efficiently
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Monitors research, industry, and economic indicators

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
