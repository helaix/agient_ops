# System Architecture

## Overview

The Autonomous AI Innovation Monitoring & Adaptation System is designed as a multi-layered, event-driven architecture that can operate with minimal human intervention while maintaining high reliability and adaptability.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Autonomy First**: Every component must be capable of self-operation and graceful degradation
2. **Event-Driven**: Loose coupling through event streams enables scalability and fault tolerance
3. **Layered Responsibility**: Clear separation of concerns across monitoring, analysis, and adaptation layers
4. **Adaptive Meta-Architecture**: The system can modify its own monitoring and adaptation strategies
