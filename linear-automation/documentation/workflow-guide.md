## System Architecture

### Components

The automation system consists of four main components:

1. **Automation Engine** (`automation-engine.js`)
   - Processes new issues and applies automation rules
   - Handles state transitions and label management
   - Manages priority escalation

2. **Template Manager** (`template-manager.js`)
   - Manages issue templates and validation
   - Provides template suggestions based on content
   - Validates issue quality against templates

3. **Triage Manager** (`triage-manager.js`)
   - Implements automated and manual triage processes
   - Runs daily, weekly, and monthly reviews
   - Manages issue quality validation

4. **Metrics Collector** (`metrics-collector.js`)
   - Collects workflow and quality metrics
   - Generates health reports and recommendations
   - Monitors automation effectiveness

### Configuration

All automation rules and settings are defined in `automation-config.json`:

- **Team Configuration**: Team ID, key, and metadata
- **Automation Rules**: Issue creation, state transitions, label management
- **Issue Templates**: Predefined templates for different issue types
- **Triage Process**: Schedules and guidelines for triage activities
- **Monitoring**: Metrics definitions and thresholds

## Automation Rules

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Automation Not Working

**Symptoms**: Rules not being applied to new issues

**Possible Causes**:
- API key issues
- Team ID misconfiguration
- Rule condition not met
- Rate limiting

**Solutions**:
1. Verify API key and permissions
2. Check team ID in configuration
3. Review rule conditions and test data
4. Implement rate limiting delays

#### Template Validation Failing

**Symptoms**: Issues not validating against templates

**Possible Causes**:
- Missing required fields
- Template format issues
- Validation logic errors

**Solutions**:
1. Check required fields in issue data
2. Verify template format and placeholders
3. Debug validation logic with test cases

#### Metrics Collection Errors

**Symptoms**: Metrics not being collected or calculated

**Possible Causes**:
- API rate limits
- Data access issues
- Calculation errors

**Solutions**:
1. Implement proper rate limiting
2. Verify data access permissions
3. Test calculations with known data

### Performance Optimization

#### Rate Limiting

Implement delays between API calls:
```javascript
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
```

#### Batch Processing

Process issues in batches to avoid timeouts:
```javascript
const batchSize = 10;
for (let i = 0; i < issues.length; i += batchSize) {
  const batch = issues.slice(i, i + batchSize);
  await processBatch(batch);
}
```

#### Caching

Cache frequently accessed data:
```javascript
const cache = new Map();
const getCachedData = async (key) => {
  if (cache.has(key)) return cache.get(key);
  const data = await fetchData(key);
  cache.set(key, data);
  return data;
};
```

### Monitoring and Alerts

#### Log Analysis

Monitor automation logs for:
- Error patterns
- Performance issues
- Rule effectiveness
- API usage

#### Alert Configuration

Set up alerts for:
- High processing times
- Low automation success rates
- API errors
- Threshold breaches

#### Health Monitoring

Regular health checks:
- API connectivity
- Rule execution success
- Data consistency
- Performance metrics

## Best Practices
