## üìà Metrics & Monitoring

### Key Metrics

#### Workflow Metrics
- **Issue Processing Time**: Average time in "To Process" state (Target: <24 hours)
- **Label Usage Consistency**: Percentage of properly labeled issues (Target: >90%)
- **Project Distribution Balance**: Even distribution across projects
- **Priority Accuracy**: Alignment between assigned and suggested priorities

#### Quality Metrics
- **Issues Without Labels**: Count and percentage of unlabeled issues (Target: <5%)
- **Stale Issues**: Issues without updates for >30 days (Target: <10 issues)
- **Duplicate Detection**: Potential duplicate issues based on similarity
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of issues completed within 30 days (Target: >80%)

### Health Score Calculation
The system calculates an overall health score (0-100) based on:
- Issue processing time (20 points)
- Label consistency (15 points)
- Project balance (10 points)
- Priority distribution (10 points)
- Completion rate (15 points)
- Stale issues (20 points)
- Unlabeled issues (10 points)

**Health Status Levels:**
- 90-100: Excellent ‚úÖ
- 70-89: Good üü°
- 50-69: Fair üü†
- 0-49: Poor ‚ùå
