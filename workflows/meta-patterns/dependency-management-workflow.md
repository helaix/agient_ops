# Dependency Management Meta-Workflow

## Pattern Overview
A higher-order workflow pattern for identifying, establishing, and managing dependencies between tasks across different platforms and systems, ensuring proper sequencing, blocking relationships, and progress tracking throughout a project lifecycle.

## Components

1. **Dependency Identification**
   * Analyze task relationships to identify natural dependencies
   * Distinguish between hard dependencies (blockers) and soft dependencies
   * Map prerequisite relationships between tasks
   * Identify critical path dependencies that affect project timelines

2. **Dependency Representation**
   * Define consistent formats for representing dependencies
   * Establish clear visual indicators for dependency relationships
   * Create machine-readable dependency metadata
   * Implement bidirectional dependency references

3. **Cross-Platform Mapping**
   * Map dependency concepts across different platforms (GitHub, Linear, etc.)
   * Establish translation mechanisms between different systems
   * Maintain consistency in dependency representation
   * Handle platform-specific dependency features

4. **Dependency Validation**
   * Verify successful creation of dependency relationships
   * Check for circular dependencies or invalid relationships
   * Implement dependency health checks
   * Create visualization tools for dependency verification

5. **Dependency Tracking**
   * Monitor status changes that affect dependencies
   * Implement notification systems for blocked/unblocked status
   * Track dependency chain completion
   * Generate dependency-aware progress reports

6. **Dependency Adaptation**
   * Handle changes to dependency relationships
   * Implement mechanisms for dependency restructuring
   * Manage dependency exceptions and overrides
   * Support dynamic dependency creation and removal

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Analysis Phase**
   * Review project structure to identify natural dependencies
   * Map existing implicit dependencies
   * Define dependency types and categories
   * Establish dependency representation standards

2. **Setup Phase**
   * Implement dependency creation mechanisms
   * Set up cross-platform mapping tools
   * Create validation and verification systems
   * Establish baseline dependency structure

3. **Execution Phase**
   * Create and maintain dependencies according to plan
   * Monitor dependency status and health
   * Address dependency-related blockers
   * Adapt dependency structure as project evolves

4. **Review Phase**
   * Analyze effectiveness of dependency management
   * Identify improvements for future projects
   * Document lessons learned
   * Refine dependency management approach

## Applicability
This meta-workflow is particularly effective for:
* Complex projects with many interdependent tasks
* Multi-platform development environments
* Projects with sequential or phased execution
* Teams working across different systems and tools
* Projects requiring strict task ordering

## Example Implementation
The GitHub-Linear sync for Sparkflow implemented this pattern by:
1. Analyzing workplan files to identify sequential task dependencies
2. Creating a consistent format for representing dependencies in workplans
3. Mapping GitHub workplan dependencies to Linear blocking relationships
4. Implementing GraphQL mutations for creating dependencies in Linear
5. Verifying dependency creation with validation queries
6. Visualizing dependency chains for verification and tracking

## Relationship to Other Workflows
This meta-workflow encompasses and coordinates several base workflows:
* GitHub-Linear Sync Workflow
* Task Sequencing and Prioritization
* Blocker Resolution Workflow

It can be part of higher-level meta-meta-workflows such as:
* Adaptive Coordination System
* Project Lifecycle Management Framework

## Benefits
* Ensures proper task sequencing and execution order
* Provides visibility into task dependencies and blockers
* Enables effective cross-platform dependency management
* Reduces coordination overhead and miscommunication
* Supports complex project structures with many interdependencies
