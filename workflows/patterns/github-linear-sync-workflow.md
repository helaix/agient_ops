# GitHub-Linear Sync Workflow

## Pattern Overview
A systematic approach to synchronizing workplans, tasks, and dependencies between GitHub repositories and Linear project management, ensuring consistency across platforms while preserving hierarchical relationships and tracking progress effectively.

## Components

1. **Workplan Structure Definition**
   * Define consistent structure for workplans in GitHub repositories
   * Establish metadata format for capturing Linear-relevant information
   * Create templates for different types of workplans (epics, tasks, etc.)
   * Define conventions for representing dependencies between tasks

2. **Metadata Extraction**
   * Parse workplan files to extract structured metadata
   * Identify hierarchical relationships between workplans
   * Extract task dependencies and sequential workflows
   * Map GitHub workplan attributes to Linear issue fields

3. **Linear Issue Creation**
   * Create epics for high-level workplans
   * Generate child issues for sub-tasks
   * Apply appropriate labels and project associations
   * Establish parent-child relationships in Linear

4. **Dependency Mapping**
   * Create blocking relationships between dependent tasks
   * Verify dependency creation with validation queries
   * Maintain sequential workflow integrity
   * Visualize dependency chains for verification

5. **Synchronization Triggers**
   * Define events that trigger synchronization (file changes, manual triggers)
   * Implement change detection for workplan updates
   * Create mechanisms for selective synchronization
   * Establish bidirectional update protocols

6. **Status Tracking**
   * Monitor completion status across platforms
   * Update GitHub workplans based on Linear status changes
   * Implement completion verification mechanisms
   * Generate progress reports across the task hierarchy

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Planning Phase**
   * Define workplan structure and metadata format
   * Establish mapping between GitHub and Linear attributes
   * Create templates for different workplan types
   * Define synchronization triggers and frequency

2. **Setup Phase**
   * Implement metadata extraction mechanisms
   * Create Linear API integration scripts
   * Set up authentication and access controls
   * Establish initial synchronization baseline

3. **Execution Phase**
   * Monitor workplan changes in GitHub
   * Trigger synchronization based on defined events
   * Verify successful creation of Linear issues and relationships
   * Track completion status across platforms

4. **Maintenance Phase**
   * Monitor synchronization effectiveness
   * Address any discrepancies between platforms
   * Update synchronization logic as needed
   * Document lessons learned and improvements

## Applicability
This workflow is particularly effective for:
* Projects with detailed planning documents in GitHub
* Teams using Linear for task tracking and management
* Workflows with complex task dependencies
* Projects requiring hierarchical task organization
* Teams needing visibility across documentation and execution

## Example Implementation
The Sparkflow project implemented this pattern by:
1. Creating structured workplan files in the `effectify-workflow` branch
2. Developing a synchronization script that extracts metadata from workplans
3. Using the Linear GraphQL API to create epics, tasks, and dependencies
4. Implementing a GitHub Action for automated synchronization
5. Verifying dependency relationships with validation queries
6. Documenting the process for future improvements

## Relationship to Other Workflows
This workflow complements and enhances:
* Task Decomposition and Recomposition Meta-Workflow
* Hierarchical Communication and Reporting Workflow
* Dependency Management Workflow

It can be integrated with:
* Adaptive Coordination System
* Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment Workflows

## Benefits
* Ensures consistency between planning documents and execution tracking
* Preserves hierarchical relationships and dependencies
* Provides visibility into project progress across platforms
* Reduces manual effort in maintaining multiple systems
* Enables effective coordination across complex task hierarchies
