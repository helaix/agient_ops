### 6. Rules
   * Define coding standards and conventions
   * Establish API usage guidelines
   * Document security and compliance requirements
   * Create testing and quality assurance standards
   * Define deployment and maintenance procedures

### 7. Spikes
   * Conduct technical research and proof-of-concepts
   * Validate integration approaches
   * Test performance and scalability assumptions
   * Explore alternative implementation strategies
   * Document findings and recommendations

### 8. Reviews
   * Conduct systematic code and design reviews
   * Validate implementation against requirements
   * Perform security and performance audits
   * Gather stakeholder feedback
   * Document lessons learned and improvements

   * Validate integration approaches with real APIs
   * Test performance and scalability assumptions
   * Explore alternative solutions and trade-offs

### Review Phase (Step 8)
1. **Quality Assurance**
   * Conduct comprehensive code reviews
   * Perform security and performance audits
   * Validate against original requirements
   * Test edge cases and error scenarios

2. **Stakeholder Validation**
   * Gather feedback from end users and stakeholders
   * Validate user experience and functionality
   * Document lessons learned and improvements
   * Plan for future iterations and enhancements

## Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Hierarchical Delegation
- **Manager Agent**: Orchestrates the overall workflow and coordinates between steps
- **Specialist Agents**: Handle specific steps (PRD, Architecture, UX, etc.)
- **Implementation Agents**: Execute specific technical tasks within each step

### Communication Protocols
- **Status Updates**: Regular progress reports between agents
- **Dependency Management**: Clear communication of blockers and dependencies
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Documentation of decisions and learnings
- **Quality Gates**: Review checkpoints between major phases

### Git Branch Management Strategy
- **Main Branch**: Stable, production-ready code
- **Feature Branches**: Individual step implementations
- **Integration Branches**: Combining work from multiple steps
- **Review Branches**: Staging areas for quality assurance
