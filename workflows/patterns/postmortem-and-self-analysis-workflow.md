# Postmortem and Self-Analysis Workflow

## Pattern Overview
A structured approach to reflecting on completed work, extracting learnings, identifying patterns, and documenting insights for future improvement and knowledge transfer.

## Components

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   * Record all instructions received and actions taken
   * Document decision points and rationales
   * Capture challenges encountered and solutions implemented
   * Note any sub-optimal aspects and how they were addressed

2. **Pattern Identification**
   * Analyze workflows and processes that emerged during execution
   * Identify recurring patterns and effective approaches
   * Recognize meta-patterns that span multiple activities
   * Categorize workflows by level of abstraction (workflow, meta-workflow, meta-meta-workflow)

3. **Generalization and Abstraction**
   * Extract generalizable principles from specific implementations
   * Define reusable workflow patterns with clear components
   * Create implementation guidelines for each pattern
   * Identify applicability criteria for different contexts

4. **Knowledge Structuring**
   * Organize insights into a coherent knowledge structure
   * Establish relationships between different workflow patterns
   * Create a hierarchy of patterns from concrete to abstract
   * Develop a taxonomy for categorizing workflow patterns

5. **Documentation for Reuse**
   * Create detailed documentation for each identified pattern
   * Include components, implementation guidelines, and examples
   * Specify applicability criteria and limitations
   * Provide relationship mapping to other patterns

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Preparation Phase**
   * Schedule dedicated time for reflection immediately after project completion
   * Gather all project artifacts and communication records
   * Review project timeline and key decision points
   * Identify participants for collaborative reflection (if applicable)

2. **Analysis Phase**
   * Review the entire project chronologically
   * Identify key workflows, challenges, and solutions
   * Look for patterns across different project phases
   * Extract generalizable principles and approaches

3. **Documentation Phase**
   * Create structured documentation for each identified pattern
   * Organize patterns into a coherent knowledge structure
   * Establish relationships between patterns
   * Ensure documentation is accessible and reusable

## Applicability
This workflow is particularly effective for:
* Complex projects with novel approaches
* Projects that encountered and overcame significant challenges
* Work that involved multiple coordination patterns
* Activities that could be replicated in different contexts
* Projects that generated significant organizational learning

## Example Implementation
The Remotion Media Parser research coordination implemented this pattern by:
1. Creating a comprehensive postmortem documenting all aspects of the research coordination
2. Identifying key workflow patterns used during the process
3. Generalizing these patterns into reusable workflows, meta-workflows, and meta-meta-workflows
4. Creating detailed documentation for each pattern with components and implementation guidelines
5. Establishing relationships between different workflow patterns

## Relationship to Other Workflows
This workflow complements and extends:
* Documentation Synthesis Workflow
* Knowledge Transfer Framework

It generates inputs for:
* Coordination Strategy Library (part of Adaptive Coordination System)
* Organizational learning repositories
* Training materials for future coordinators
