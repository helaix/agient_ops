# Business Idea Evaluation Workflow

## Pattern Overview
A systematic approach to evaluating business ideas using high-leverage filters and structured analysis, ensuring comprehensive assessment while maintaining consistency and quality across all evaluations.

## Components

1. **Initial Idea Capture and Structuring**
   * Capture business idea in standardized format
   * Define core value proposition and target market
   * Identify key assumptions and hypotheses
   * Establish evaluation scope and timeline

2. **High-Leverage Filter Application**
   * Apply 80/20 principle analysis (highest impact factors)
   * Evaluate using Star Principle criteria (market size, growth, competitive advantage)
   * Assess model advancement impact (threat vs. opportunity)
   * Apply additional strategic filters (timing, resources, capabilities)

3. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**
   * Market opportunity assessment
   * Technical feasibility evaluation
   * Competitive landscape analysis
   * Resource requirement estimation
   * Risk and mitigation planning

4. **Scoring and Prioritization**
   * Apply weighted scoring across evaluation dimensions
   * Calculate overall viability score
   * Rank against other business ideas
   * Identify critical success factors

5. **Decision Documentation and Next Steps**
   * Document evaluation rationale and key findings
   * Provide go/no-go recommendation with confidence level
   * Outline implementation roadmap for viable ideas
   * Archive evaluation for future reference and learning

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Preparation Phase**
   * Gather all available information about the business idea
   * Identify subject matter experts and stakeholders
   * Prepare evaluation templates and scoring rubrics
   * Define success criteria and decision thresholds

2. **Evaluation Phase**
   * Apply high-leverage filters systematically
   * Conduct parallel research streams for different dimensions
   * Gather external validation and market feedback
   * Document findings and evidence for each criterion

3. **Synthesis Phase**
   * Consolidate findings across all evaluation dimensions
   * Calculate weighted scores and overall assessment
   * Identify key risks, opportunities, and dependencies
   * Prepare recommendation with supporting evidence

4. **Decision Phase**
   * Present findings to decision makers
   * Facilitate discussion of key trade-offs and assumptions
   * Document final decision and rationale
   * Plan next steps for approved ideas

## High-Leverage Filters

### Primary Filters (Must Pass)
1. **Market Size & Growth** - Addressable market must be significant and growing
2. **Competitive Advantage** - Clear differentiation or defensible position
3. **Resource Alignment** - Matches organizational capabilities and resources
4. **Timing** - Market timing and competitive landscape favorable

### Secondary Filters (Optimization)
1. **80/20 Impact** - Focus on highest impact opportunities
2. **Star Principle** - Market leadership potential in attractive segment
3. **Model Advancement Impact** - AI/tech advancement creates opportunity vs. threat
4. **Strategic Fit** - Aligns with broader organizational strategy

### Risk Filters (Mitigation)
1. **Execution Risk** - Ability to successfully implement
2. **Market Risk** - Customer adoption and market acceptance
3. **Technology Risk** - Technical feasibility and scalability
4. **Competitive Risk** - Response from existing players

## Integration Points

### With Research Coordination Workflow
- Use research coordination for multi-dimensional analysis
- Delegate specific research areas to specialized agents
- Synthesize findings using established research patterns

### With Task Decomposition Workflow
- Break complex evaluations into manageable components
- Parallel execution of different evaluation dimensions
- Systematic recomposition of findings

### With Decision Documentation
- Link to existing documentation patterns
- Maintain evaluation history and learnings
- Support continuous improvement of evaluation criteria

## Applicability
This workflow is particularly effective for:
* Early-stage business idea validation
* Strategic initiative prioritization
* Investment decision support
* Product roadmap planning
* Market entry evaluation

## Success Metrics
* Decision quality (measured by subsequent outcomes)
* Evaluation consistency across different ideas
* Time to decision for business ideas
* Stakeholder confidence in evaluation process
* Learning and improvement over time

## Example Implementation
The AI Model Advancement Impact business idea evaluation demonstrates this pattern by:
1. Structuring the core insight about model advancement impacts
2. Applying high-leverage filters to assess market opportunity
3. Researching competitive landscape and timing factors
4. Scoring across multiple dimensions with weighted criteria
5. Providing clear recommendation with implementation roadmap
