## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Initialization (Day 1)

#### Step 1: Create Parent Issue
```markdown
Title: Gemini Live Interface to [Target System] Implementation
Description: 
This is the top-level management issue for implementing a Gemini Live Interface 
to [Target System]. This issue will serve as the coordination point for a manager 
agent to orchestrate the entire 8-step workflow.

Scope:
- Voice and text interaction with [Target System]
- Natural language processing for user intents
- Function calling to [Target System] APIs
- Conversation state management
- Real-time and asynchronous communication modes

Manager Agent Responsibilities:
1. Workflow orchestration following the 8-step pattern
2. Sub-issue creation with proper scaffolding
3. Agent coordination and progress monitoring
4. Integration management and quality assurance
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Git Repository Structure
```bash
# Create main feature branch
git checkout -b feature/gemini-live-interface-main

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p {docs,src,tests,config}
mkdir -p docs/{prd,architecture,ux-ui,project-overview,workplans,rules,spikes,reviews}

# Create initial scaffolding files
touch docs/README.md
touch src/README.md
touch tests/README.md
touch config/README.md

# Commit initial structure
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initialize Gemini Live Interface project structure"
git push origin feature/gemini-live-interface-main
```

### Phase 2: Requirements & Planning (Days 1-3)

#### Step 3: Create Sub-Issues for Each Workflow Step

**Sub-Issue 1: Product Requirements Document**
```markdown

2. **Resolve Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite steps are completed
3. **Facilitate Communication**: Enable cross-step collaboration
4. **Quality Assurance**: Review deliverables at each step

**Example Progress Tracking:**
```markdown

```

#### Step 5: Technical Spike Coordination

**Spike Execution Example:**
```typescript
// Example spike implementation for Gemini Live API integration
const geminiLiveSpike = async () => {
  console.log('Starting Gemini Live API integration spike...');
  
  // 1. Basic connection test
  const connection = await establishGeminiConnection({
    apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY,
    model: 'gemini-live-preview'
  });
  
  // 2. Latency measurement
  const testCases = [
    'Create a new issue',
    'Show me my recent pull requests',
    'What is the status of project X?'
  ];
  
  const latencyResults = await Promise.all(
    testCases.map(async (input) => {
      const startTime = performance.now();
      const response = await connection.processVoice(input);
      const endTime = performance.now();
      
      return {
        input,
        latency: endTime - startTime,
        success: response.success,
        confidence: response.confidence
      };
    })
  );
  
  // 3. Function calling validation
  const functionTest = await connection.testFunctionCalling({
    name: 'create_linear_issue',
    parameters: {
      title: 'Test issue from spike',
      description: 'Testing function calling capability'
    }
  });
  
  return {
    connectionSuccess: connection.isConnected,
    averageLatency: latencyResults.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.latency, 0) / latencyResults.length,
    functionCallingSuccess: functionTest.success,
    recommendations: generateRecommendations(latencyResults, functionTest)
  };
};
```

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Days 19-22)

#### Step 6: System Integration
