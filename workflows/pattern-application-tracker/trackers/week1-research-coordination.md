## Blockers and Risks

### Current Blockers
- None identified

### Identified Risks
1. **Resource Constraints**: Limited time for comprehensive research across 5 areas
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize critical path items, time-box research activities
2. **Information Overload**: Risk of collecting too much information without synthesis
   - **Mitigation**: Establish clear evaluation criteria and synthesis checkpoints
3. **Research Scope Creep**: Risk of expanding beyond defined boundaries
   - **Mitigation**: Regular scope reviews and boundary enforcement
