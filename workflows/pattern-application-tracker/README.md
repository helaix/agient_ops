# Workflow Pattern Application Tracker

## Overview

This directory contains the implementation of the Documentation-Implementation Bridge Agent functionality to systematically apply documented workflow patterns to active projects. It tracks the application of meta-patterns to current workstreams and measures effectiveness.

## Implementation Status

- [x] Directory structure created
- [ ] Pattern schedule configuration
- [ ] Metrics tracking system
- [ ] Week 1: Research Coordination application
- [ ] Week 2: Task Decomposition application
- [ ] Week 3: Structured Feedback application
- [ ] Week 4: Hierarchical Communication application
- [ ] Effectiveness measurement dashboard
- [ ] Continuous improvement feedback loop

## Usage

1. **Pattern Application**: Use the weekly tracker files to apply patterns systematically
2. **Metrics Collection**: Track effectiveness using the metrics dashboard
3. **Progress Reviews**: Generate weekly reports using the scripts
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Update patterns based on effectiveness analysis

## Integration

This tracker integrates with:
- Linear issues for task management
- GitHub PRs for code changes
- Existing workflow pattern documentation
- Team communication channels

## Next Steps

1. Configure the 4-week pattern application schedule
2. Set up metrics collection for each pattern
3. Begin Week 1: Research Coordination Workflow application to Austin MVP
4. Establish weekly review cadence
