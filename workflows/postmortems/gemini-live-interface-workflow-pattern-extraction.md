## Generalizable Workflows Identified

### 1. Multi-Phase Technical Implementation Workflow
A systematic approach to breaking complex technical implementations into manageable phases:
- Planning & Requirements (Steps 1-4)
- Development & Validation (Steps 5-7)
- Integration & Deployment (Step 8)

### 2. Template-Driven Development Workflow
Using standardized templates to ensure consistency and completeness:
- Template creation for each workflow step
- Placeholder-based customization approach
- Quality assurance through template compliance

### 3. Agent Specialization Workflow
Assigning specialized agents to specific workflow steps:
- Manager agent for orchestration
- Specialist agents for domain-specific steps
- Implementation agents for technical execution

### 4. Progressive Quality Assurance Workflow
Implementing quality gates throughout the development process:
- Requirements validation gates
- Technical review checkpoints
- Integration validation points
- Deployment readiness criteria

### 5. Documentation-First Implementation Workflow
Prioritizing comprehensive documentation before and during implementation:
- Requirements documentation before development
- Architecture documentation before coding
- Process documentation during execution
- Lessons learned documentation after completion
