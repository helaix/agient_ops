# GitHub-Linear Sync Implementation Checklist

This checklist provides a structured approach to implementing GitHub-Linear synchronization for your project. Use it to ensure all necessary components are properly configured and tested.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Linear workspace is set up and accessible
- [ ] GitHub repository contains structured workplan documents
- [ ] Linear API key with appropriate permissions has been created
- [ ] GitHub repository secrets are configured for storing API keys
- [ ] Node.js environment is available for running scripts

## Planning Phase

- [ ] Review existing workplan structure and format
- [ ] Document metadata format and extraction requirements
- [ ] Define mapping between GitHub workplan elements and Linear issues
- [ ] Identify hierarchical relationships to preserve
- [ ] Document dependency relationships to establish
- [ ] Define synchronization triggers and frequency
- [ ] Establish error handling and recovery procedures

## Implementation Phase

### Linear Configuration

- [ ] Identify appropriate team for issue creation
- [ ] Create or identify "Epic" label for epic-level workplans
- [ ] Map project phases to Linear projects
- [ ] Define issue states for tracking progress
- [ ] Configure appropriate issue templates if needed

### Script Development

- [ ] Implement Linear API authentication
- [ ] Create team and project lookup functions
- [ ] Implement workplan parsing and metadata extraction
- [ ] Develop epic creation functionality
- [ ] Implement task creation with parent-child relationships
- [ ] Create dependency establishment between sequential tasks
- [ ] Implement verification queries for relationship validation
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Test script with sample workplans

### GitHub Action Setup

- [ ] Create GitHub Action workflow file
- [ ] Configure appropriate triggers (file changes, manual)
- [ ] Set up environment and dependencies
- [ ] Configure secrets access
- [ ] Test workflow with sample workplan changes

## Testing Phase

- [ ] Test epic creation with sample workplan
- [ ] Verify parent-child relationships are correctly established
- [ ] Test dependency creation between sequential tasks
- [ ] Verify project association is working correctly
- [ ] Test error handling with invalid workplans
- [ ] Verify synchronization triggers work as expected
- [ ] Test manual synchronization process
- [ ] Validate results in Linear workspace

## Documentation Phase

- [ ] Document synchronization strategy and approach
- [ ] Create technical implementation guide
- [ ] Document workplan format requirements
- [ ] Create user guide for maintaining workplans
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures
- [ ] Create postmortem of implementation process
- [ ] Document lessons learned and improvement opportunities

## Deployment Phase

- [ ] Finalize script and workflow implementation
- [ ] Perform initial synchronization of all workplans
- [ ] Verify all epics, tasks, and relationships are correctly created
- [ ] Train team members on workplan maintenance
- [ ] Establish monitoring and maintenance procedures
- [ ] Set up regular validation checks

## Maintenance Phase

- [ ] Schedule regular verification of synchronization integrity
- [ ] Monitor API changes and update implementation as needed
- [ ] Collect feedback on synchronization effectiveness
- [ ] Implement improvements based on feedback
- [ ] Document ongoing maintenance procedures

## Enhancement Opportunities

- [ ] Implement bidirectional synchronization
- [ ] Add status tracking across platforms
- [ ] Create visualization tools for dependency chains
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution mechanisms
- [ ] Add notification system for synchronization status
- [ ] Develop dashboard for monitoring synchronization health
