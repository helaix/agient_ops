# Data Processing Workflows

## Overview

The data processing workflows component orchestrates and executes both batch and streaming data processing jobs across the pipeline. This layer ensures data is processed reliably, efficiently, and according to business requirements, while maintaining proper dependencies and scheduling.

## Architecture

![Processing Workflows Architecture](../documentation/processing_architecture.png)

### Key Components

1. **Workflow Orchestrator**: Manages job dependencies, scheduling, and execution
2. **Batch Processing Engine**: Executes scheduled batch jobs
3. **Stream Processing Engine**: Processes real-time data streams
4. **Job Repository**: Stores job definitions and configurations
5. **Monitoring & Recovery System**: Tracks job execution and handles failures

## Workflow Types

### Batch Processing Workflows

1. **ETL/ELT Jobs**
   - Scheduled data extraction, transformation, and loading
   - Incremental and full refresh patterns
   - Dependencies between data domains

2. **Data Quality Checks**
   - Scheduled validation of data quality metrics
   - Anomaly detection and alerting
   - Data reconciliation between systems

3. **Aggregation & Rollup Jobs**
   - Period-end aggregations (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Pre-computation of common analytical views
   - Historical data summarization

4. **Maintenance Operations**
   - Index rebuilding and optimization
   - Partition management
   - Data archiving and purging

### Streaming Processing Workflows

1. **Real-time Transformations**
   - Stream-to-stream processing
   - Windowed aggregations
   - Pattern detection

2. **Continuous Enrichment**
   - Joining streams with reference data
   - Real-time feature computation
   - Context addition

3. **Alerting & Monitoring**
   - Threshold-based alerting
   - Anomaly detection in streams
   - SLA monitoring

4. **Data Synchronization**
   - CDC-based replication
   - Multi-system consistency
   - Real-time data propagation

## Workflow Design Patterns

1. **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**
   - Explicit dependencies between tasks
   - Conditional execution paths
   - Dynamic task generation

2. **Idempotent Processing**
   - Safe re-execution capabilities
   - Exactly-once processing semantics
   - Deduplication mechanisms

3. **Parameterized Workflows**
   - Reusable workflow templates
   - Runtime parameter injection
   - Environment-specific configurations

4. **Stateful Stream Processing**
   - Windowing strategies (tumbling, sliding, session)
   - State management and checkpointing
   - Watermarking for late data handling

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Dynamic worker allocation
   - Partitioned execution
   - Load-based autoscaling

2. **Resource Optimization**
   - Job prioritization
   - Resource pools and quotas
   - Cost-based scheduling

3. **Backpressure Handling**
   - Rate limiting
   - Buffer management
   - Graceful degradation strategies

## Reliability & Recovery

1. **Failure Detection**
   - Heartbeat monitoring
   - SLA tracking
   - Dependency failure propagation

2. **Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Automatic retries with backoff
   - Partial reprocessing capabilities
   - Checkpoint-based recovery

3. **Circuit Breakers**
   - Prevent cascade failures
   - Graceful degradation
   - Self-healing mechanisms

## Monitoring & Observability

1. **Execution Metrics**
   - Duration, resource usage, throughput
   - Success/failure rates
   - Data volume processed

2. **Business Metrics**
   - Data freshness
   - Processing SLA compliance
   - Business impact metrics

3. **Logging & Tracing**
   - Structured logging
   - Distributed tracing
   - Root cause analysis capabilities
