# Comprehensive Data Pipeline Architecture

This document outlines the complete architecture for a scalable, maintainable data pipeline system designed to handle multiple data sources, perform complex transformations, store data efficiently, process both batch and streaming data, visualize key metrics, and maintain the system over time.

## Architecture Overview

![Data Pipeline Architecture](./documentation/architecture_diagram.png)

The data pipeline architecture consists of six main components:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Collects data from multiple sources
2. **Data Transformation & Cleaning**: Processes and standardizes data
3. **Data Storage**: Stores data in appropriate formats and schemas
4. **Data Processing Workflows**: Handles both batch and streaming data
5. **Data Visualization**: Presents key metrics and insights
6. **Documentation & Maintenance**: Ensures system longevity and reliability

Each component is designed to be modular, allowing for independent scaling, maintenance, and technology updates as needed.

## Component Integration

The components work together in the following sequence:

1. The **Data Ingestion Layer** collects data from various sources and forwards it to the transformation layer
2. The **Transformation & Cleaning** processes standardize and clean the data before storage
3. The **Data Storage** component stores the processed data in appropriate schemas
4. The **Processing Workflows** component runs both scheduled batch jobs and real-time streaming processes on the stored data
5. The **Visualization** component accesses processed data to display key metrics and insights
6. The **Documentation & Maintenance** procedures ensure the entire pipeline remains operational and up-to-date

## Technology Stack

The architecture leverages the following technologies:

- **Data Ingestion**: Apache Kafka, Apache NiFi, custom API connectors
- **Transformation**: Apache Spark, dbt, Python data processing libraries
- **Storage**: Data Lake (S3/HDFS), Data Warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery), MongoDB
- **Processing**: Apache Airflow, Apache Spark Streaming, Kafka Streams
- **Visualization**: Tableau, PowerBI, custom dashboards with D3.js
- **Maintenance**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack for monitoring

## Implementation Roadmap

The implementation will follow this sequence:

1. Set up the data storage infrastructure
2. Implement the data ingestion layer
3. Develop transformation processes
4. Configure processing workflows
5. Create visualization dashboards
6. Establish documentation and maintenance procedures

Each component has its own detailed design document in the respective subdirectory.
