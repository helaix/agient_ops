# Data Storage Architecture

## Overview

The data storage component provides a scalable, reliable, and efficient system for storing data at various stages of the pipeline. This architecture implements a multi-tiered storage approach to balance performance, cost, and accessibility requirements.

## Architecture

### Key Components

1. **Data Lake**: Raw and processed data storage in object storage
2. **Data Warehouse**: Structured analytical data storage
3. **Operational Data Store**: Optimized for operational queries
4. **Metadata Repository**: Stores metadata about all datasets
5. **Cache Layer**: High-speed access for frequently used data

## Storage Tiers

The storage architecture implements the following tiers:

1. **Raw Data Zone (Bronze)**
   - Stores data in its original format
   - Immutable storage of source data
   - Typically in object storage (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)
   - Partitioned by source and ingestion time

2. **Processed Data Zone (Silver)**
   - Cleaned and transformed data
   - Standardized formats (Parquet, Avro, ORC)
   - Optimized for processing efficiency
   - Partitioned by logical domains and time

3. **Curated Data Zone (Gold)**
   - Business-level aggregations and views
   - Optimized for specific use cases
   - May include pre-computed metrics
   - Designed for consumption by end-users and applications

4. **Serving Layer**
   - Specialized data structures for specific access patterns
   - May include OLAP cubes, search indices, graph databases
   - Optimized for query performance

## Schema Design

### Data Lake Schemas

- **Schema-on-Read** approach for maximum flexibility
- Metadata registry for discoverability
- Evolution-friendly formats (Parquet with schema evolution, Avro)
- Partitioning schemes optimized for common query patterns

### Data Warehouse Schemas

- **Dimensional Modeling** for analytical workloads
  - Fact tables for measurements and events
  - Dimension tables for entities and attributes
  - Conformed dimensions across fact tables
- **Data Vault Modeling** for enterprise data warehouse
  - Hubs for business entities
  - Links for relationships
  - Satellites for descriptive attributes

### Specialized Schemas

- **Time-Series Optimized** for IoT and event data
- **Graph Schemas** for relationship-heavy data
- **Document Schemas** for semi-structured content

## Technology Selection

### Primary Technologies

- **Object Storage**: Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage
- **Data Lake**: Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi
- **Data Warehouse**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Synapse
- **NoSQL Databases**: MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB
- **Specialized Stores**: InfluxDB (time series), Neo4j (graph), Elasticsearch (search)

### Supporting Technologies

- **Metadata Management**: Apache Atlas, Amundsen, DataHub
- **Data Catalogs**: AWS Glue Catalog, Azure Data Catalog
- **Caching**: Redis, Memcached
- **Compression**: Snappy, GZIP, LZO, ZSTD

## Data Lifecycle Management

1. **Retention Policies**: Time-based and usage-based retention rules
2. **Archiving Strategy**: Automated movement to cold storage
3. **Purging Procedures**: Compliant data deletion processes
4. **Versioning**: Historical versions of critical datasets

## Performance Optimization

1. **Partitioning Strategies**: Optimize for query patterns
2. **Indexing**: Appropriate indexes for frequent access patterns
3. **Compression**: Balance between storage efficiency and query performance
4. **Materialized Views**: Pre-computed aggregations for common queries
5. **Caching Layers**: In-memory caching for hot data

## Security & Governance

1. **Encryption**: Encryption at rest and in transit
2. **Access Control**: Fine-grained access control at table and column level
3. **Masking & Tokenization**: Protection for sensitive data
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all data access
5. **Lineage Tracking**: Record of data origins and transformations

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Establish data lake foundation
2. **Phase 2**: Implement data warehouse schemas
3. **Phase 3**: Deploy specialized data stores
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize performance and implement advanced features

## Integration Points

- **Receives From**: Data Transformation Layer
- **Provides To**: Data Processing Workflows, Visualization Layer
- **Dependencies**: Authentication services, encryption services
